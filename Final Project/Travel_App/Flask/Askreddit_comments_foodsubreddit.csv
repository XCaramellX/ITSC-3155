1,dwg33yp,t3_87wckw,"A lot of pushups, running in place, masturbation, meditation and trying to recall specific memories in detail.  I'd try to think about specific things I've learned in a lot of detail.  I'd do a lot of praying. 

I think I'd try to teach lessons out loud or practice speeches, make up songs / poems / dirty limericks / jokes etc.  I'd try to take a topic such as outer space and recall everything that I know on this topic.  I'd also day dream a lot, and probably rant about things that had troubled me in the past.  I would not be ashamed or afraid to speak out loud.",t3_87wckw

5,dwg2jg9,t3_87wckw,"You should check out [this Mind Field episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqKdEhx-dD4). It's harsher than it looks, but for that amount of money I'd attempt it anyway. 

I think I would end up playing with my food a lot to pass the time. Like that game where you get a bottle of water to stand on end, or making sculptures out of mash potatoes, that sort of thing. If I get bored with that I'd resort of mental mathematics. I'd also try to keep physical active, push-ups, sit-ups, etc. ",t3_87wckw
6,dwg1quf,t3_87wckw,"One month in an empty room in exchange for enough money to comfortably retire on and never work again in my life? I'd take the deal. To keep sane, I'd meditate, and maybe make a pillow fort or do something with the food other than eat it. I could like, make macaroni art on the floor. It would be challenging but definitely worth it.",t3_87wckw
7,dwg2u4m,t3_87wckw,"I would try to vividly remember everything I've ever liked.  I'd think of songs, books and movies I like and try to dissect what I like about them and how they relate to other things and what they mean to me. Greatest hits of memories. Think of the future. Think about what kind of life I want to live when I get out, try to prioritize what means the most to me and plan what steps I can take when I get out to make what I've been thinking about a reality. 

I think it's doable if you know it's only a month and there is a reward at the end.  When people go crazy from isolation it tends to be because they have no idea if or when it will end. Even if it does end, the future still tends to be bleak. The hopeless is what gets you, not the isolation. ",t3_87wckw
8,dwg3ky4,t3_87wckw,"I think $5,000,000 for a month would entice me to give it a go and I imagine the thought of that much money would motivate me to stick it out. But, I am aware of the effects of solitary confinement and how it can have lasting effects on you. 

I spend most of my time alone so the lack of people wouldn't bother me I don't think. However, I don't spend all my time alone just eating, drinking, sleeping and staring at four walls which I would be doing in the experiment. That would be tough.

Edit: I also think a difficult aspect of the experiment would be not knowing what's happening in the world around you. With information always seconds away with our devices, a month without that information at our fingertips would be irritating, in my opinion.",t3_87wckw
9,dwg1g6c,t3_87wckw,"I'd probably have a full on mental breakdown at some point. It would be hell and I'd hate it. But, the month would end, I'd have 5 million dollars and a pretty good premise for a book.",t3_87wckw
10,dwg7v02,t3_87wckw,"I could probably sleep without a bed, so I would tear it apart and use the shreds to make a village out of dolphin people. I could color them somewhat using the food and water to spice things up. After the village is complete, I would convince myself that I am a dolphin too, and would make whale noises for the next four weeks as I attempt to learn their language. If I'm lucky, I might even get a job as a shell slinger at the local stadium.",t3_87wckw

14,dwg1f8t,t3_87wckw,"Like unlimited food of my choosing? I think if I could do that I'd be ok.
I spent 16 hours in a detox cell after getting a DWI though and I was already counting and recounting bricks and getting a little anxious by the time I got out. Every time they brought food I felt a little relief. I think it would be tougher than people think.",t3_87wckw

Doing a slightly longer bid with a light switch and a toilet that actually functions would be fucking great. Coping strategies? Sleep all day, nap, eat, nap, sleep. Work out. Shadowboxing is a great one in solitary. Forget about time, it's an abstract concept in this box. There is no time, there's only activity.

28,dwgbkgx,t3_87wckw,"I accept the challenge because initially all I see is green and the number of trailing zeros at the end of that payout. 

Day 1: 

I enter the room and I entertain myself pretty well for the about the first 10 minutes. Then I itch for my phone and for the ability to scroll Reddit or check my messages. I violently crush those thoughts and try to focus on something else, like what I would do with the money and how much I would allocate to a specific thing. 

I’m also thinking about all the cool things I’ll be able to do and all the countries I’ll be able to visit. Somewhere in the back of my mind the itch to Google something or look something up is always present, but it eventually becomes more wishful thinking than an itch.  

I am able to occupy some of my time this way.

Day 2-4:

Much of it goes like Day 1, except the loneliness is gradually getting larger.

Day 5-6: 

My thoughts have moved past what I will be doing with the money and now existential questions are hitting me, like what will I do with my life from now on? How will this impact my relationships? Is there a God? How do I masturbate without porn?


Day 7-10:

I decide that I must find some hobbies, even if isolated. At this point it’s only been a week but I miss my boyfriend, I miss my friends, and I miss knowing what’s going on in the world. I even miss the Kardashians dammit. I practice singing because at least my voice will only torture myself this way. I try to make up some poetry or fantasize about what kind of DnD storyline I would make up if I was a dungeon master. Little things that keep me creative despite not having things like paper and a pencil.

Day 11:

Sadness and the fact that I’ve had no human contact for 11 days hit. I spend most of this day crying, just hit by a giant wave of loneliness and paranoia about what might be happening in the outside world. What if someone I love was hurt, or worse, DEAD? I would have no way of knowing. That is the most terrifying part.

Day 12-13:

Much like Day 11, but increasingly manic. When I’m not crying I fill the empty hours with sleep.

Day 14: 

It’s getting near the halfway point. I have to struggle it out - I’ve dedicated so much time already. I decide that maybe I’ll write a book about it, and brainstorm thoughts.

Day 15:

I start to sleep more, exercise a bit; being alone with my thoughts make them too loud, so I try to keep myself occupied. 

I start talking to myself a little more.

Day 16 - 30 I can’t fathom really.

You can find god. You can decontruct your wire frame bed and make cool ass metal sculptures.

There's a high likelihood that I'd start pulling apart various things in the room to make them more engaging. Knotwork from fabric, pull the toilet apart just to see if I could put it back together again... I'd try making jailhouse booze, cheese, and dyes.

Assuming there's toilet paper, it wouldn't be difficult to have some serious arts and crafts time, but if a bidet is involved, it would probably take 30 days alone just to get used to the sensation of intentionally subjecting myself to Neptune's Kiss.

Basically what he did was read everything from religious texts, scientific textbooks, classics, and even more. He learned a few languages and played music a lot. 

The ending gets kinda interesting though. The terms of the bet said that he had to stay in complete isolation for the full 15 years, but after reading and learning so much, he decided that he didn't want the money and left the isolated place a few hours early and forfeited the prize.

-count how many pancakes can fit in the room. Sounds insane but you start to do it and you realize how quickly it can occupy your brain. I can tell you calculating one room from start to end witj calculators and scratch pads took like an hour. But trying to do it very precisely would be very painstaking. A lot of this can be done with an McGyvered toilet paper abbicus. I have a few puzzles similar to this. 
-make beats and write songs. You have 6 different surfaces, so plenty of beat combos. Have y'all tried making 4 beats a day for three summers?! No but write songs. 
-I'm also just a writer writer so there's a lot I could write but it sounds like I don't have a pen. So. Memorize.

Got various colors of food, paint on the walls. Got cans? Use them in improvised games like bowling or throwing or stacking games. 

We could even get into some concepts of ""enlightenment"" training like the idea of beong able to transfer water into your hands without spilling a drop or the idea of punching water to develop the strength of your punches

You start to feel miserable, feel unworthy of human attention or just feel to apathetic to bother. Then you end up isolating yourself, shutting yourself off from human contact and the outside world. A lot of the time other people don't know that you're suffering as you didn't tell them because you genuinely believe they won't care or that it'll bother them. So often they won't come to visit you or check in on you, which only feeds that rapidly growing feeling of being neglected, worthless and uncared for. The repetitive nature of your activities fails to stimulate you properly, but the depression causes you to withdraw more and more, rather than to seek out new activities or stimulus like someone with a healthy mind would do. It's fuckin horrible and it's so easy for that cycle to suck you in and smother you before you even know what's happening. It's why whenever I feel my depression starting to creep into the corners of my mind, I force myself to exercise, to get out of the house once a day and at least tell my friends what's going on so they can make up their mind as to whether they want to come and see me or not and will at least check on me.

Just based on opinion I definitely don't believe color to be the most important thing for mental stimulus. That said, there are studies about It being important so take my words with a grain of salt.

Personally, I definitely think that the inability to measure time is far more devastating for the human mind. We must keep track of everything based on time. Long term memory formation, sleep cycles, emotional health are all controlled by our cycle of night and day. When that gets interrupted and we don't have an anchor to say ""yes, I stubbed my toe on a Monday!"" and that memory becomes an event in an endless stream of events with no anchor to separate them then you start going nuts.

Imagine not being able to accurately remember the sequence of events... I took a shower, took my shoes off, put them on, put then under the bed. Obviously it may not be so extreme but you can imagine how lost you'd be once your ability to grasp and mark your position in time is gone. ",t3_87wckw

You’ve pretty much nailed the cycle. I break it and I feel a thousand times better but the cycle of self-misery is a lot fucking easier and far more seductive than all the work to get out. This is of course with help of a therapist who even got to the point of thinking I was a-OK

When the break up happened she warned me not to hole myself away (going into therapy herself, done a lot of work with anxiety and trauma for herself) as she knew exactly what it would entail. And in typical gender stereotyped male fashion I'm not always very emotionally vulnerable (with her being a big exception) and am a pretty quiet and thoughtful person. I’ve done my best by living with others so I can only withdraw so much. Luckily I’ve always been good at school and the expectation of being somewhere and showing up for shit (unfortunately sporadic work) is something I value so I haven’t hit the depths that are possible but I am quite scared if I move out and go for it alone then I’ll hit those depths real quickly.

Just wanted to say thanks for summarizing something that probably plagues more than 30% of us but society doesn’t want to really accept it since it means you’re not a functioning capitalist.

They were in an all out war and every day after school I'd go back and check the progress on the carnage. The black colony would make progress most days, pushing the reds back stone by stone. Eventually, the reds had their larva rooms invaded and begin evacuating; I could see ants carrying individual larvae away from the black invaders in a desperate struggle to preserve their colony. After a while, all reds had either fled to a new site or were exterminated, and only the blacks were left. It was a wild ride.

Edit! 

Inspired by our witnessing of The Great Ant War, my brother and I decided to get a couple of ant colonies. We went all out and got like 3 or 4 different ones with little tube connectors that would let your colony expand indefinitely. After blowing through money on all that, we looked into getting some high-quality ants shipped in from out of state, but decided we should save on our ants and get some from the back yard. 

We intercepted several convoys traveling an ant highway (as they release scents when returning from food sources for others to follow in line) and began building our colony. It was a peaceful colony of tunneling and ants just doing what ants do...at first. On one of our resupplies we must've inadvertently picked up an ant in the same spot from another colony and we unknowingly dropped him to his doom. 

The next day after dropping the fresh ant in, I noticed something odd in the corner at the surface. There was a little pile of rubble formed from a hole that was dug out. In it...was the dismembered remains of the new ant. The others must've figured out he wasn't from around there and they cut his head and legs off and neatly piled him up in the corner. That was when I first learned ants actually create designated graveyards for their deceased. Ants are cool man. I should get some again.",t3_87wckw

Dream journals can be a spiritually satisfying exercise in understanding your unconscious mind, helping you to fully examine your being, and balance your emotions. They also can be rife with useful data for government officials and corporate marketing executives.*

*Of course, dear listeners, many of you are saying, “Well, this sounds fantastic, Cecil, but how do you keep a dream journal?” Good question.*

*I have kept one for years now, and I must say I agree with the NVPA on this. It seems hard, at first, because you have to get in the habit of writing first thing in the morning, and also because the City Council’s ban on all writing utensils is still in full effect. But once you learn how to create a makeshift non-pen out of a cocktail straw, some cotton, and any number of colorful municipal food pastes, you’ll be good to go.*

*In an effort to educate Night Vale citizens about dream Journaling, the NVPA has created this helpful how-to:*

- *Step One: Find a foreign dictionary or hymnal. It is strongly preferred that you choose something in Russian or Ukrainian, but German will work too.*
- *Step Two: Carve out several pages, creating a secret compartment in the book.*
- *Step Three: Write down your dream in great detail the moment you wake up.*
- *Step Four (and this is the most important step of all): Eat the paper you wrote the dream on, and then place a bird skeleton in the book.*
- *Finally, bury the book near a magnolia or willow tree, and repeat each day.*

*The sooner you start this process, listeners, the sooner you can start actualizing your existence, exploring your inner self, and the sooner the Sheriff’s Secret Police can track down and arrest those vile miscreants who keep dreaming about horses.*",t3_87wckw

Steak.

Salad.

Smoothies.

Bread.

Ice Cream.

Processed is the killer, eat fresh, unprocessed food in moderation and it's healthy.  Mixing fresh milk, cream, salt, vanilla beans, and sugar cane and churning it doesn't suddenly make any of those ingredients toxic or bad for humans.

Eating a scoop of the delicious vanilla ice cream that comes out isn't at all unhealthy, eating the whole thing every single day might be.

Healthy food is delicious food is all food.  The problem comes when you're buying bread in a bag filled with so much processed corn syrup and preservatives and putting packaged lunch meat on there with god knows what animal parts and preservatives and slathering mustard that will last a decade on top all from plastic containers where they've sat for who knows how long.

Get a nice cut of meat from the butcher, bake a loaf of bread, make your own mustard or sauce, and suddenly that same sandwich isn't quite so bad for you at all.

As someone who has struggled with healthy eating my whole life and gained and lost hundreds of pounds, took a long time for me to finally snap out of the ""you can't eat this"" mindset and get into the ""track what you eat, don't go over your macros, and make sure what you're eating is as unprocessed with as few ingredients as possible"" mindset when trying to eat healthy.",t3_f1citv

Different enzymes are required to digest different types of food. Our bodies pre-produce enzymes for the foods that it expects we will eat. So, in short, if you are currently in a diet high in fats and processed carbs, ""healthy"" food will not only be hard to digest, but unpalatable.

However, if you were to, say, go vegetarian for six months, while cutting bread, you'll find that you've actually started to crave the food that you now have available, and foods that you previously craved will now seem bland and uninteresting.

So, tastes aren't some fixed thing that are the same for everyone. Neither are they some genetic lottery that you're predisposed to.

If you don't let it oxidize, you might as well be eating white bread for all you get out of it. The compound that acts as an antioxidant is created by the decomposition of allicin, which gives garlic its taste and strong scent.

We have built into us a natural drive to eat things which are salty, sugary and fatty in order to survive. Foods with these flavors do not run rampant in the wild, so we have an instinct to eat as much of  it as we can when we finally come across something with those characteristics.  


Junk food companies know this, and so pump their products with very high levels of all three. ...Sometimes in the same single product. And often when it doesn't seem to make sense. For example: did you know that there is Sugar in sliced bread? Look at the label.  


Now, junk food is so crammed with crap that our tastebuds have acclimated to the high salt, sugar and fat content. When we stray from the junk and eat something healthy, our mouths tell us what we're eating is bland and insipid.  


But it's not. Not even close.  


Thing is, you'll never know that until you step away from the junk, eat healthy and stick with it for a while. Before you know it, you will begin to taste what Real Food tastes like. And you will like it. Stick with it even further, and you will even Crave real food.

Once boiled / canned ones have been rinsed, toss in oil. If you dont, they get rock hard and it'll hurt to eat. Spread out on cookie sheet and lay down the salt. I usually add black pepper too and cook as is. Takes about 30-45 mins at 375F. Longer if you cook a lot all at once. They taste like potato chips and are still high potassium but have a lot more fiber, protein, and iron. I often make ~2-3 cups worth of peas and carry them in a bag for a snack at work. Lasts me all week, I dont feel hungry around lunchtime, and its not starchy or sugary (blood sugar crashes make me real hungry) If I'm at home, I like to dip in red pasta sauce. 

Plain greek yogurt makes a great high protein, low/no fat sour cream substitute but idk how it does in cooking or baking. You can also add a little of those powdered ranch packets to taste and make a low fat chip dip. Never tried it with the chickpeas but with regular potato chips I couldnt tell the difference.

I havent tried this but a redditor showed me their dieting crackers a while back. They juice carrots and take the pulp for the cracker which whould be almost all fiber. I think they bind it with egg, a little flour, honey and/or a small amount of vital gluten. They used rosemary for seasoning. I couldnt say how big they were, maybe 2x the size of a Cheez-It, but they said just 4 made them full.

I take my prepped sprouts, toss them in a bowl with olive oil so they're coated, season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasoning, then roast on a baking sheet in the oven for about 20 minutes at 400.

Tried it, but messed up. What we ended up doing was this:

Tear the kale leafs into chip-sized shreds and lay flat on a pan. Lightly cover in olive or vegetable oil. Bake at... 420°F(?) for 15(?) minutes, until they're kinda dark brown almost black. Let them cool and salt them a little to taste.

Fruit is not bad for you. I mean, if you were only to consume fruit and nothing else, then yeah, but they're not ""sugar bombs/balls."" People comparing it to candy are so off-base.

They do have sugar in them but all sugar is not equal in the way it affects the body. In the case of fruit, the sugars are bound to fiber, so when the body metabolizes them it does so slowly and doesn't spike your blood sugar\* in the same way (this isn't important so much for the initial spike, but for the subsequent drop when your body overestimates the need for insulin), as compared to refined sugar which is absorbed more immediately (drop). This is part of the reason for the Glycemic Index, which most fruits are notoriously lower on. (Though it's more complex than just the GI score)

On top of that, they possess phytonutrients\* (which play an important roll too. Fiber is initial, but phytonutrients have been found to inhibit the transportation of sugars through the intestinal wall into our blood and can block some of the intake of sugar into cells lining our intestines)\[2\], antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, and good dietary fiber, and when included in a balanced diet, are quite important/helpful.

Taking an example; an average banana has about 14 grams of sugar. But, eating a banana is good for you and has some nice benefits - and won't spike your blood sugar/drop in the same way. (My step-father is diabetic and his dietitian has recommended a banana in the morning for this purpose alone.) On the other hand, eating 14 grams of pure refined sugar, though the same amount, is bad for you, will spike your blood sugar, and can lead to the development of certain diseases later on.

In closing, natural sugars (and other carbs, with keto being trendy) are not inherently bad for you (if again, they aren't the sole source of your nutrition) like they're demonized to be. Refined, processed forms in inordinate amounts are. However this also applies to (other) carbs, to proteins, and to fats. For example - an avocado contains a lot of fat, but they're wonderfully healthy, because fat isn't inherently bad.  But eating the refined, processed oil from an avocado *is* bad. Whole grains are wonderful, but eating their processed flours are not. And so on.

Anyways, don't be afraid of fruit, my gosh.

Edit: Haha, yes I meant blood sugar not pressure. Second, here’s some articles (links to sources/studies included) for those interested, I will try to respond to individual comments asking more later. :)

I buy a big bag of baby carrots at the store, and I pat them dry with some paper towels. Then some butter and olive oil (I prefer to use chili infused oil for the carrots) and let that simmer till bubbly, the toss all the carrots in the oil/butter mixture. When they start to crisp where the pan makes contact, I stir and toss while adding a liberal amount of salt to further draw out moisture.

Once a nice sear mark has developed on the carrots, I toss in a liberal dusting of chili powder, cayenne, a bit of sugar and a healthy drizzle of honey or agave nectar if you want to stay more vegetarian or vegan friendly. If you'd prefer full vegan, substitute the butter for coconut oil. Will not give same results and you need to change how much is in the pan, but it still works.

After the glaze begins to caramelize, I throw in a dash of dried thyme and rosemary, the rosemary I have either chopped more fine or otherwise ground it to be smaller in particulate size.

Once this is all done, I cut heat, and let the glaze thicken.

End result should be a sweet and spicy glazed carrot with crunch, but at the same time soft, as they are cooked.

I love making my Spiced Carrots as a side to go with my Ribeye steaks I make.

The true secret to making these spiced carrots is both the texture, making sure to barely cook the carrots so they still have resistance as you chew, and the chili powder. A slight smokiness with a pinch of heat, as well as the caffeine in the spice waking up your taste buds.

The steak I like to cook with salt, pepper, dash of chili powder, and in the butter/oil mixture on a high heat for that quick sear and perfect Maillard Reaction.

Serve with charred grape tomatoes and a really good baked mac (I make mine with 3 cheddar, 1 swiss, and smoked gouda along with spices).

The main disadvantage to frozen produce is that the tissues may have been damaged by ice crystals, so you have to use or prepare it in certain ways to avoid an unpleasant texture.

EDIT: RIP My inbox. First of all, thanks everyone for the Cake Day wishes, I didn't even notice!

2nd of all: To address the ""Big Mac isn't the equivalent"" comments. At the time, I was just thinking he was ordering the standard signature burger from the menu, of which the Whopper is the Signature Burger of Hungry Jacks, and the Big Mac is the Signature Burger of McDonalds. It didn't cross my mind to think of quarter pounders as closer to the actual whopper burger, because, well, to a teenager making minimum wage I'm not going through the list options that could be the possible equivalent. All I could do was explain we don't have Whoppers at McDonalds, here is what we sell, you don't want to listen fine, are you happy with x alternative instead. You said yes? Great, take your burger and piss off.

Some people have pointed out the McFeast and Quarter Pounder Deluxes as nearly the same burger to the Whopper - when I worked at McDonalds (which was 8 years ago), QPD weren't a thing (never heard of it to this day actually, I don't eat at Maccas much), and the McFeast at the time was a limited edition menu item. It came and went seasonally. I believe now it's a standard menu item, but at the time it wasn't always available and certainly not when this incident occurred.

There's a long silence and finally someone (not the person who's been yelling) says, ""Wait, this isn't \*insert some totally not Panera sounding place that I don't remember here\*?""

""No.""

We have a giant 16-bay steam table directly in front of the serving counter. It's old and some pans don't sit quite right so there's always a bit of steam leaking out. Our trailer is built around one item, empanadas (not really but similar), the trailer is even called that. All the signs advertise empanadas in big letters.

So one day it's like 90˚ out and sweat is just running off of all of us. We're packed, the line  is running down the street, and we're eight servers deep at the window. Customer comes up to the window, after standing in line for probably fifteen minutes, sees us with soaked shirts and headbands, steam pouring out of the table and they ask; ""What flavors of Ice Cream do you have?""

The first woman said some simple, pleasant greeting like, “Hi, how are you?” to the second one, which somehow developed, within the space of about two to three minutes, into the second woman’s reply in the form of a monologue about how she was sorely abused by her mother as a child, but her mother was now dead, and she still missed her, even though she also severely neglected her, which lead to the plethora of health problems she has suffered, starting in her teens with abnormal puberty and only getting worse from there, and her abusive relationships with men... The first woman looked at me like *”Ho-lee Hell”* and finished paying and picking up her order and abandoned me to listen to the rest of the second woman’s woes. She also had children who were all ungrateful and just never wanted to have anything to do with her, even in the throes of her worst illnesses and health issues, and some of them have completely cut her off, it’s all her former husbands’ fault, and her dead mother’s, because she (this rambling woman, not her dead mother) is too nice of a person, she is too loving, she is too giving, she loves her children too much and gave them too much...

She sat on her motorized cart just continuing her speech about her life of torment, and all her stuff was bagged, I’m just standing there waiting for her to pay. She won’t shut up. She can’t take a damn clue. The line is backing up behind her. She still won’t shut up. She’s talking about how her husbands made her work when she shouldn’t have, and her kids abuse her, her son threw her out of his house for no good reason when she was just trying to help him... I’m not even saying anything to her. Like, WTF am I supposed to say? “I’d diagnose you with a latent case of narcissistic personality disorder, intelligence-lacking type, perhaps histrionic personality disorder, except I can’t because I’m a fucking Walmart cashier and not a psychiatrist.” But I was a pretty scared young kid at that time and felt too awkward and on-the-spot to say anything. Not even a peep of “Ma’am could you please pay?”

I once had a woman come through the drive through and try to order Macaroni and cheese. I politely informed her we did not have that. She insisted we did. I told her we definitely didnt. She got angry and yelled that yes we did. I told her ""ma'am Ive been working here 3 years. We have NEVER had macaroni and cheese. Its not something we serve. Would you like to order something else?"" Shes says ""yes you fucking do! I can see it on the menu board! Its RIGHT there right in front of me on the menu!"" I tell her Im really not sure what shes looking at, but we dont have mac and cheese, and if it really does say mac and cheese on our menu board then that means someone vandalized it. She says no, its definitely part of the menu board and its real and we do have it, and she isnt leaving until she gets her mac and cheese.

Cue quite literally 10 minutes of this back and forth, all while she's holding up the drive through line. I finally got the manager to come over and deal with it after asking him for the 15th time because they dont pay me NEARLY enough to deal with that for that long.

The woman absolutely REFUSES to accept that we dont have mac n cheese. She also refuses to order anything else, and wont move her car until we give her the mac and cheese that we dont have. We have a line of cars wrapped around the building now and everyone is pissed. Its been half an hour and the line has not moved.

The manager tells her if she doesnt leave, he's gonna have to call the cops. She screams she cant understand why we're doing all this, and why we wont just serve her mac and cheese when she can CLEARLY see it on our menu board right in front of her so we DO have it and why are we lying to her?

My curiosity and exasperation finally got the better of me, so against my better judgement, I exit the building, walk along the outside to the drive through order screen where this woman's car is. 

I tell her to please show me on the menu where it says the words ""macaroni and cheese"" anywhere.

She points and confidently says ""Right there!"" With all the conviction of someone who is absolutely sure they just proved some big dumb idiot wrong and that they will be hailed as a hero.

I look where shes pointing.

I see it.

I sigh heavily as a bit more of my soul dies.

I compose myself and say, as politely as I possibly can:

""Ma'am""

She demanded to speak to a manager right then and there and said we needed to call her and put her on over the drive-thru speaker. Both managers went straight to voicemail. We said we couldn't reach them and she screams, ""THIS IS THE WORST SONIC I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!""

We're all bamboozled. Like what the actual fuck just happened.

It's slow, so he definitely gets what he ordered. 2 minutes later, he comes back through and says he ordered a #2, but did not get the correct sandwich. I instruct him to pull around and we would give him another sandwich (the correct one) free of charge. I get the sandwich, check that it's the right one before handing it out, hand it out. End of story, right?

Wrong.

2 minutes later, he comes inside and is irate because he has come through the drive-thru twice now and both time recieved the wrong sandwich.

I was working in the back when a new trainee came rushing over, absolutely bawling, so I immediately knew something was seriously wrong. J had her stay in the back to calm down and alerted the head manager from the office so we could go tackle the situation.

I get to the register and find a rather petite Korean lady, shouting very loudly and demanding the trainee come back and saying she was stealing and trying to cheat her out of her money. She also kept shouting what I can only assume were strong obscenities in Korean.

The manager looked at her with an expression that basically said, ""oh, no. She's too much for me to deal with."" So he said he'd handle the line of people that was formed and I got the pleasure of dealing with Korean Karen.

Somehow I managed to keep a level head and asked her calmly to explain her situation. She was screaming and yelling and rambling about how upset she was and claimed the cashier refused to give her any change and that the bagels she wanted were too expensive.

I handled giving her the change and reruns her bagels up so they came out to a better total. (The trainee had keyed them in individuals instead of as a pack which changes the price, it was literally her first day by herself.)

The whole time I'm packing up her dozen and a half bagels, she's still being pissy and is waving her arms around in a fit and bumps a customer next to her.

He very politely, and sternly said ""Excuse me!"" And she decided to take this opportunity to SPIT on him.

While all this has been going on, the assistant manager had called the cops as he'd been witness to her fit from the beginning, and a cop came in right after.

As I'm finishing slicing up all her stuff, the cop is trying to ask her questions, again, very calmly, what is the problem, whats her name.

Then he asks to see her identification. And she goes ballistic. Shoves the cop, who has kept his hands tk himself this whole time, and SPITS at the cop! He tries to take her wrist and orders her to put her hands behind her back and out of nowhere she lets out this howling scream and starts trying to fight with this guy and is shoving him around. His partner comes in and sees the commotion and immediately jumps in, they're shoving into the refrigerator items and tackle her to the ground.

They take her out to their police car in cuffs and come back inside to pick up her personal items that were dropped in the fray and ask me if anything else was hers and I gladly handed them her change and bagels.

TL;DR - crazy Korean Karen throws a fit. Cops get called. She puts up a crazy fight and ends up arrested, but she got her bagels and change that she wanted.

Edit: oh my gosh this blew up! Thank you all for the awards! Also, this customer being Korean had nothing to do with anything really. People of all backgrounds would get bent out of shape over the dumbest things. I only added the detail to fully convey the surprising strength and fight coming from such a small framed woman. And that her shoutung was in a language I do not speak. It also was just too funny to not have the alliteration of ""Korean Karen"".",t3_imr79a

I worked at O'reilly auto parts and we frequently had people that tried to return stuff they bought at AutoZone or advance. This was usually an understandable mistake because it was almost always a mechanic that just forgot where they bought something, or even just drove to the wrong store by mistake. 

But this one guy.... He came in talking on the phone (never a good sign) and asked me to return something, handed me a receipt, then turned around to continue his conversation. I immediately realized that he had the wrong receipt and tried to get his attention, making me look like a dick for ""interrupting"" his conversation, told him that he had the wrong receipt and got his phone number to look it up. While I was doing this I over heard him say ""yeah, I'm at AutoZone returning that part"", so I look through his profile and sure enough, he never bought the shit at o'reilly's. I tried to interrupt him again and tell him that he was in the wrong store and he just waved me off. Obviously, he wanted to finish his conversation, so I let him. I help a few more customers and after hearing him say ""I'm at AutoZone"" again (I'm assuming this was a different conversation), , so I loudly said ""YOU'RE AT O'REILLY'S DUDE, AUTOZONE IS DOWN THE STREET"". He completely ignored me. The dude spent a good 15 minutes on the phone before walking back over to the counter and said ""Alright, did you return the thing yet?""",t3_imr79a

Basically, he'd have to pay for a more expensive burrito that has more ingredients, take off most ingredients and sub for rice, so the drive-thru girl tells him to come inside to our self-orderkiosk instead as it'd be easier for him to order that way (without over paying).

Well he was not happy...

1) Man explains the plot of star wars on the phone, then starts talking about how his sex life wasn't negatively impacted by being Asian and how he owned ""multiple beautiful electronics"". He accidentally put the phone on speaker and it was hold music. Then he asked for free coffee, didn't get any, and left. 

2) Middle-aged woman asked to see my manager saying that I took her order wrong because her burger didn't have jalapenos. I had tried to explain that she'd ordered the green chile burger (local promotion) and that we didn't have a Jalepeno burger. She screamed. My manager tried to explain that green chiles and jalapenos were different and the threw the mostly eaten burger in his face and started yelling at people. So the Manager calls the cops while she's still yelling about how we were all going to be arrested for fraud. Cops arrive and tell her to leave. She starts yelling about how ""those goddamn dirty fucking spics stole my money. Put them in jail."" Not that it matters, but neither myself nor my manager were Hispanic, just dark hair an tanned. She straight told the cop that, as an affluent white woman, she expected him to arrest us for our ""insubordination"". I mean the cops in the area were pretty racist and he handled her with kid gloves/apologized to her. She spit on him anyway and got cuffed.

3) Four people got out from a desert furry con and showed up to get quarter pounders at midnight. They were really nice, but it was... interesting to have for people in fur suits chatting at the table. At least they took their masks off. Two of them were talking about how the Cuban Revolution needed to be judged by the historical conditions of its time and how this applied to Palestinian liberation. The other two made OwO noises at each other.

EDIT: So recalling the furry story lead me to googling funny furry stuff which lead me down a rabbit hole to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RFun58Gt7A&ab_channel=AllGasNoBrakes) video and I've half-convinced myself the guy at the beginning talking about Palestine and cow pussy might be one of the dudes I saw, since he was also black and had a similar suit.

I can tell you how to find our menu online, or perhaps if you tell me what you're looking for I could suggest...""

""No, I don't need to see the menu. We're at the hotel next door, like I said, we just need a loaf of white bread, some eggs and milk, and some butter. We're going to my sister's house tomorrow for a family gathering and I'm supposed to bring things to help cook. Are you telling me you don't have bread, butter, milk, and eggs there?""

Well, fuck. I mean. Yeah, we do. We do a lightly toasted bread garnish on some dishes, and obviously a restaurant kitchen stocks milk, eggs, and butter. I put her on hold and go get my manager.

2047,g42sig8,t3_imr79a,"I've actually had a ""Ma'am, This ISN'T a Wendys"" before.  


I used to work at a Tim Hortons that also had a Wendy's under the same roof. Common in Canada, where I live. We got along with each other and gave each other the free stuff we got (We got free coffee and donuts and they got free fries and fountain pop). I was a teen working my first job so I wanted to stand out. When the 2nd night shift employee didn't show up, I offered to take their place and do a double shift. (I don't recommend this by the way, as I got home from school, came to work, worked 16 hours, then went back to school from work. Brutal day for me, but luckily it was a Friday)  


Anyways, The Wendys crew closed at 11pm, but we were open 24 hours. Around 2AM this woman drives up to my speaker box and this happened:  


Me: Hello, welcome to Tim Hortons, can I take your order?  


Her: Hey yea, Can I just get a Baconator please?  


Me: Uh, unfortunately this is the Tim Hortons window. Wendys closed at 11PM.  


Her: Yea I drove up there and no one answered, so I came here. Anyways, can I just get a Baconator Combo with Root Beer?  


Me: Ma'am, this isn't Wendys, we don't make burgers (we only had, at the time, donuts, cookies and pastries.)  


Her: Yea I know, I'm not stupid. But could you like, go over and make me it?  


Me: No.  


Her: ....... This is fuckin' bullshit man, I just wanted a burger.  


Me: There a McDonalds literally down the road thats 24/7.  


Her: \*pauses for a moment peels out of the drive through\*

I gave her the benefit of the doubt and told her that we don't have those items and offered here the 4 for 4 instead. She replied with ""you got rid of those!? I never thought this would happen"". Understanding her confusion, I said ""Ma'am this is Wendy's"" and then gave her directions to Arby's. She said ""Ope, I must have taken the turn too early"" For reference; Arby's was across the highway.

A month or so goes by and I'm grilling, but I have a headset. We get a car and they take the order. I knew the voice in an instant ""I'll take 2 roast beef and cheddars and a large curly fry with cheese sauce"". The employee taking the order was new, and asked if we had any of those things. I turned my microphone on and said that Arby's was across the highway. She, once again, replied with ""ope, I must have taken the turn too early"" and drove off.

This process repeated about once every month or two.

Another month or so after the last one; I'm the manager. I hired my sister who hit a rough patch to give her a quick job. Put her on order taking, the beep came through signaling a car. She told them to go ahead with their order, and yet again, I knew the voice in an instant. ""I'll take 2 Beef and Cheddars and a large curly fry with cheese sauce"". My sister gets flustered easily and I decided to let her take care of this for entertainment. They debated on menu items and my sister (who was brand new) tried to find these items on the computer to put them in. None of them are on there. This went on for several minutes until the elderly woman said ""wow this is a Wendy's, I must have taken the turn to early"".

After that, I never heard her voice again. Never received the 2 Beef and Cheddars and a large curly fry with cheese sauce order again. Me telling her that she was at the wrong place must have never clicked in her head to not repeat the mistake. The confusion with my sister forced her to learn it for herself, and she never came back.

At this point, she pushes the salad towards us and continues yelling, but I start making the new salad just to get her out of the store. This sent her into an even bigger rage.

2083,g430j53,t3_imr79a,"I was an assistant manager at a McDonald's years ago and I'll never forget this story. I just so happen to be working the window when this particular lovely women pulls up to the speaker. I proceed with the usual ""Welcome to McDs How may I help you today?

Me- Ma'am, I'm sorry we don't have that here..

Karen- What the fuck you mean you ain't got that!!?? 

Me- Ma'am I'm sor....

Karen- You better give me my MF burritos! 

She then proceeded to punch the menu board and speaker box, whips her car around to my window. 

Karen- I need to speak to your MF manager!! How can you not have any quesadillas at lunchtime?! What kind of shitty ass people work here?! Don't you CARE about the customers? 

More screaming...something about I probably ate the last one, and I should go on diet. So, finally she shut up for 2 seconds for me to tell her as I point to my hat and the big yellow M logo on my shirt..

""Lady, this is McDonald's, not Taco Bell..Taco bell is across the street"" 

Karen looks ahead, looks back at me, and drives off. No apology, no oops, my bad, nothing. No surprise here. People like that never apologize or acknowledge they are wrong. Of course,  you all know that. And, I should point out that this happened way more than it should have. I've had people walk inside McDonald's, walk up to the counter, look directly at the menu and start calling out their Taco Bell order. So, there ya go. Don't get it.

Many years ago now, I went to lunch with a friend at a Wendy's nearby. We went inside got our food and sat down.

I opened my sandwich to take a look and for some reason there was no meat on it. Saw the lettuce, onions, ketchup, etc but no meat. Suddenly I actually got super excited because I could go up to the kid behind the counter and say ""Where's the Beef?"" Yes, I could finally use Wendy's old marketing slogan against them!

So I'm practically giddy as I walk up to the counter. I stare across to the very uninterested, possibly high teenager behind the counter and proudly say ""WHERE'S THE BEEF?"" and open my burger.

...and it was there.

I have no idea how I missed it. None. I literally checked twice and didn't see it. Either way, the end result was one of the most awkward moments of my life. The kid just stared as I said ""oh, uh...there it is"" and sheepishly went back to my seat.",t3_imr79a

They approached and asked what the issue was, apparently the $2 bills were fake, as they've never seen them before.

I worked at zaxbys and if people called and complained about an order and didn’t want to come back in at the same time, the manager would write the name and details in The Book. If someone came through the drive thru wanting to claim their meal from The Book, we were instructed to tell them they had to come in to do that. 

One family abused this rule terribly and often. They’d order about $10 worth of fried chicken and call back 20 min later with the claim that they’d ordered $50 worth of food and it was all burnt/greasy/whatever. This continued on an almost weekly basis for YEARS. They always used the same name and refused to come inside. They’d demand to speak to the manager at the window and the manager would always cave. 

My favorite manager was so annoyed with it and was like next time, tell them If they don’t come in they don’t get their food.

So the next time this happens, this lady comes around and I tell her per the manager she has to come inside and she starts verbally abusing me. Ok. And I’m like 🤷🏼‍♀️.

My absolute favorite was when I came out of a room from coding a patient, respirator and face shield literally dripping with sweat since it was just me on compressions for a solid 30 minutes. As soon as I step out, there's a patient with the classic Karen haircut asking me where the shower is. I explain that we don't have a shower. She starts getting irate and says ""I've been in my room an hour and the doctor hasn't bothered to come see me!"" She had only been in her room for 10 minutes. The nurse comes up as I'm telling her that I'm not capable of building a shower for her to use. The nurse then tells her she could use the very painful and expensive chemical rinse shower. She huffs off to her room. 
Then the doctor comes out of the code room after hearing all that. She goes into the patient's room and the patient starts yelling about a shower because her vag stinks. So the doctor looks her dead in the eye and says ""You can wash your pussy in the sink and shut your mouth.

Thankfully, our store wasn't her main Starbucks so I didn't see her often.

One morning though, a half hour into being open, just my manager  , another worker, and me are working. I'm working the drive window and two cars pull in and as they are pulling in the second car starts honking at the first. Not just one honk, not two, just laying on the horn for seconds at a time, hitting it over and over. They both get in the drive lane, I start taking the first cars order, the second car keeps honking over and over wildly.

The first car pulls up, I ask my manager to take the second car's order. Lady in the second car is the overly-emotional intense lady. She tells my boss that the lady in the first car cut her off pulling in to the parking lot.

I'm busy dealing with the first car, my boss is asking the second car not to honk in the drive like that. She pulls up and as soon as she is right behind the first car again she starts honking again. We're losing our minds, we can't understand at all what she thinks is going to be changed by her acting this way. First car pulls away and this lady pulls up and I am trying very hard to act as if she hasn't spent the last five minutes honking and thrashing around with anger in her car. I give her the total, she yells, she cut me off coming in, she could have killed me. I tell her that's wild, pause, tell her the total. She looks at me and I have no ability to be sympathetic because she has burned through any sympathy several visits before. She is shaking and barely containing rage at a person who has already driven away. As I go to hand her the drink she bought, she says, you're laughing at me and you should feel sorry for me, I'm the victim! I just said, ""I don't feel anything about it, I just pass things through a window, that's all"". She drove away and didn't visit us again for almost a year.

I know Starbucks would like me to have calmed her down, offered her the drink for free, assured her that we were all on her side, tell her that sometimes people are shit and we all understand.

They were talking about lobotomies but I wasn't really paying attention to the specifics and then the female EMT turned to me and said hey what's your opinion on and then kind of gives me a look and goes ""oh god this kid doesn't even know what a lobotomy is, why would I even bother asking a KFC worker."" so as I counted out their change I calmly explained what a lobotomy was.

(It's a Frozen Coffee btw) I took the order and then i had to go ask my boss what the heck a Frappe was cause I had no idea what to put in. They still poke at me for not knowing what a Frappe is lol.

2121,g437wua,t3_imr79a,"I was a manager for a local Coffee shop. My favorite “Karen/ Wendy’s moment” 
A ritzy looking woman came in on the phone, loudly talking to whom ever via head phones, after holding up the line she finally took a second to order a Frappuccino thrusting her Starbucks card at me. She quickly scurried away after i slid her card back at her saying  “we aren’t Starbucks”  I Tried, unsuccessfully, for several minutes to get her attention again. 

I Gave up and took the next order curious to see how long it would be before she came and screamed at me. A full 11.5 minutes later (I timed her haha) she stormed up to the counter demanding her Frappuccino. 
“Oh my god, where is my drink. Those people were after me. What is taking so long?” 

I explained we do not have a blender, ice cream, or their gross sugary powder mix, so we had none of the ingredients or tools to make one. The customer began yelling at me saying she was friends with the corporate manager of Starbucks and that she’d get me fired for sure for how ignorant I was because I “clearly had a blender” she mistook our industrial coffee maker as a blender. :/

“Ma’am we are not Starbucks, we do not have corporate...” she cut me off again screaming “what do you mean this isn’t star bucks? Sure looks like a fucking Starbucks to me.” I took a step back kinda smiling. so, so, soooo very glad It was me that got to witness this glory.

 ""Ma’am, do you see Starbucks anywhere on our shelves? Are any of us wearing green aprons or a uniform and our walls are white and blue, everything is 50s themed and there is a logo of *not Starbucks* right in front of you. so please elaborate, how do we look like Starbucks?"" 

“Excuse me? Do you know who I am? Let me speak to your manager!” 
“Oh no, your right one moment I’ll get her.” 
I dipped below the counter and spoke to my self loud enough for her to hear. “Hey Murphy, a customer would like to speak to the manager. Okay what does she want? she thinks she’s in Starbucks and is angry because w do not have the tools or the equipment to make a Frappuccino... did you explain we are not Starbucks?... Yes but she became very aggressive and rude.... ah okay let me speak with her.” I stood up and smiled (astonished she still didn’t seem to get it) . “how may I help you? I’m the manager.” 

“Oh my god you’re the worst barista I’ve ever seen. I am never coming back.” 
“Okay thank you, You’re making my job easy I really didn’t want to kick you out.” 

Apparently she lived in the apartment complex because a few weeks later she came back (with friends) demanding a free drink while I was in the kitchen baking. Daniel came and got me. “Oh mrs Starbucks!” She turned so red and left the second she saw me. Her friends ordered and waited for their drinks politely while she stood outside.",t3_imr79a

2124,g47wknc,t3_imr79a,"Not quite fast food, but its retail and pretty damn close to a ""this is a Wendy's"" moment so I figured I'd share.

My first ever job when I was just old enough to work was at Walmart. I was stocking shelves after I had got done unloading the trucks earlier, and a lady walks up to me and just starts having this coughing fit. But shes not covering her mouth or anything and shes staring right at me.

I turn towards her and ask if shes okay and she just sort of looks around and then holds up a box of Great Value fruit snacks. And just stares at me, like shes looking into my soul to find answer to questions I don't even know. After a longgggg pause (was probably like 10 seconds but it feels way too long when someone is staring at you) she just goes ""Are these good?"" I tell her that I've had them before and they're fairly decent fruit snacks. And I start to turn to go back to shelving. I've barely reached for the next can and this big huff stops me in my tracks. I turn, and this lady has not only moved closer, but she's cornered me between my stocking cart and the shelves and shes got this impatient look on her face and shes pointing the box at me like its a gun.

""No no no,"" she says with an eye-roll, ""are they *goood*?""

""Uh,"" confused 16 year old me ""well maybe not that good?""

At this point the lady starts getting a little red in the face, and she's starting to look mad. I'm starting to get a little freaked out, thinking maybe she's on drugs or something or there's something I'm supposed to just know and I just don't. Finally she stops pointing the box at me like a gun and looks at it for a second before shoving it back in my face, jabbing at the ingredients list with her finger.

""Is. It. Good?"" she says, violently jabbing the box with each word.

""Oh... Uh,"" I pause while I try to read the list of ingredients. I grew up in a healthy household so to me the ingredients list looked pretty rough. I didn't want to upset the lady but she seemed really adamant in getting an answer.

""Well,"" I finally say ""I don't know too much, since I'm not an expert or anything, but I tend to steer clear of food coloring in food when I can, but they ingredients don't seem all that bad.""

She rolls her eyes and lets out a sharp huff.

""You know what I mean,"" she says still pointing at the list ""I don't care what they are, I just want to know if they're good?""

""The ingredients?""

""No, the quality.""

""Of the... fruit snacks?""

She looks at me like I'm the dumbest person alive and puts her hands in the air still clutching the box of fruit snacks. She turns around and I honestly am just relieved that she's going away. Until I realize that she's just looking through things on the opposite shelf. She snatches another box and this time its some kind of Great Value granola bars. This time when she puts it in my face she uses the box of fruit snacks to point, at something on the box, but I can't tell what because the box of fruit snacks is way bigger and just blocks like 90% of the granola bar box. She gives me a look and starts tapping the boxes together faster.

""Mam,"" I start, but she doesn't let me finish.

""SEE,"" she says ""is the quality good?""

""Of... the box?""

She freezes and just stares at me again. A little bit goes by and I can feel a drop of accumulated sweat from this tense encounter slide down my side from my armpit. Slowly she separates the two boxes, and at this point I'm convinced that I'm an idiot and I'm just totally missing something. This is a grown woman telling me that I know, so of course I should probably know. So I must be the idiot here for not knowing. Finally she holds both the boxes out in front of her.

""You've seen it right?"" she says impatiently tapping her foot.

""Seen wh-""

""So is it good? I just want to know the quality.""

""Mam I don't kn-""

""You work back there right!? You've seen them make it. Is the quality good?""

I just stop for a second, and as I look at the box of bars and see the Great Value logo on both, it slowly starts to sink in what she's asking.

""I... uh... Mam, we... don't make the products here.""

She rolls her eyes and holds out both the boxes again.

""These are your brands right? I saw you come from back there, so you know. Are they good?""

At this point I'm just so flustered and I'm still trying to come to terms with whats going on, and how to explain this without sounding condescending. I'm also still partially worried that maybe I'm still the idiot and I'm still not following.

""Mam... do you... think we make those products here at the store?""

""They're your brands. Just tell me the quality, I have to decide if they are worth it.""

""Mam, we don't actually make those here at the store... they get brought in... on a pallet, and then we put them on the shelves,"" I say, gesturing at the my stocking cart ""we don't make them at the store.""

""You. Work. There."" She points her arm behind her towards the back of the store. I can tell she is getting agitated.

I nod and open my mouth to try and explain but she cuts me off.

""This is your brand. So tell me. Is it ***good***?""

""Mam we don't make these in the back of the store, just like the other products they get shipped in to us. We don't have enough space to be making all these different kinds of products here. I'm sorry, I have not seen them making any of the products here. I don't think the quality is that great though.""

At this point she just lets out this angry ""harrrrrrrf"" noise from her throat, and she looks pissed.

""I STOPPED SHOPPING AT TARGET BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I KNOW YOU KNOW. WHY ARE YOU LYING ABOUT WHAT YOU MAKE?""

I'm just standing there shocked at this lady screaming and throwing a temper tantrum over something that doesn't even begin to make sense. She turns around and throws the bars and fruit snacks onto the shelf pretty hard, and knocks over a bunch of other bars.

""Mam I can get my team leader or a manager to come talk to you if-""

The look on her face was what you would expect if I had dropped my pants in the middle of the store and just shit all over the aisle. Disgust. Shock. Revulsion. She stormed out of the aisle, kicking one of the boxes she had knocked over.

TL;DR - Lady comes up to me working in Walmart, think we make all the Great Value products in the back of the store, demanding to know the quality of the products. She thinks I have seen them being made in the back. Left pissed, thinking there is some kind of retail conspiracy where we won't talk about what is being made secretly in the back of the store.",t3_imr79a

I thought I misheard it so I asked him to repeat it. When I was sure that he said Double Whopper, I replied ""A Double... Whopper?"" The shift manager then timed in on the speaker and said, ""Sir, this is a McDonald's, we don't do Double Whoppers.""

I tried going through the entire menu with her, but none of the items I listed rang a bell at all. It wasn't until we'd exhausted all of our options that she remembered: we'd forgotten her BBQ pork.

No big, people do it all the time.

She bought it all with an attitude. I told the girl working the window ""10 bucks she calls later claiming we messed it up"". (I had been a manager there for so long it's easy to spot the people). I bag her food to make sure it's perfect because I'm not explaining to my boss a $30 loss for the hour. Not even 2 minutes after pulling out she drives up to window and again starts screaming at the poor girl. So I go over and ask the crazy lady what the problem is. She complains she asked for FRENCH not RANCH. So I go no problem let me get you a ranch. The lady starts screaming this is bullshit my food is cold (2 minutes....) I demand a refund. I told her no problem I will take your food and that pop you're guzzling down them and be happy to give you your money back for what you haven't started eating. She continues to scream that she deserves a whole refund and free food ON TOP OF WHAT SHE HAS. I politely go tell her to fuck off and make a choice. Keep your food, return your food for a refund, or continue to yell and have the cops called. She starts THROWING THE FOOD BACK AT ME. I made another manager who is old and an absolute bitch to deal with her. There was no refund, no food returned after her throwing it, and she called the cops on her. I love you Carol ❤

I had a small tour of maybe five people, two parents and three kids about college age, and all of the kids looked and acted like stoners. This was the last tour of the day and my coworkers invited me to dinner whenever I got out. 

The exit of the cave is out in the woods and its a quarter mile hike back to the gift shop. I was making conversation with one of the stoner kids during this hike, and he ended up keeping me up for what felt like ten minutes outside of the gift shop, with my coworkers standing not more than a couple yards away just waiting. After an impromptu history lesson of Friedrich von Steuben, the conversation went something like this:  


Stoner: So you know a lot about history, huh?

Me: Yea, its my favorite subject by far. After I graduate college I'm hoping to become a professor of history or some academic history related job in general.

Stoner: Dude, you could be, like, a god.

Me: :?

Stoner: Like, you could go to work, doing what you love, and then come home, and like, still be doing what you love, y'know?

&#x200B;

One of my coworkers had a Native American man play his flute throughout the entire tour. Mind you, this is, like, a tour, so us tour guides are trying to speak.

We had a kids menu with some smaller items, this little friend chicken dish, and butter noodles for them. It was an incredibly busy place, and this particular family came in right smack in the middle of a Saturday night dinner rush. When taking the family's order, the mother was staring at the kids menu and I got to the kid last.

""He'll have the kid's cheeseburger"".

""Miss, we don't have cheeseburgers here."" She looks at me confused and starts to get angry.

""Idk whatever just get him the kids hotdog then"".

""...miss, we don't have hotdogs here either."" There's literally a kid's menu in her hands, and I'm trying not to laugh/yell/cry. She sits there frustrated for a few moments, but I was waaaaay too busy to just stand there and wait for her to read over the whopping 5 items on the kids menu. I ask her if she needs a minute and she doesn't respond, but the husband picked up on the fact that we were slammed and said to come back.

So, I'm at the pos when the lady comes up to me (one of my big pet peeves in service) and angrily yells ""just get the kid some fucking fries!""

I turned to her, 100% done with bullshit for the day, and tell her, ""ma'am, this is an Asian restaurant. We don't even have potatoes.""

It still boggles my mind that she reread that kids menu a bunch of times and thought to herself repeatedly 'this can't be all they have. They have to have a cheeseburger here.' like, do you know where you are right now? Bread? Cheese? Fries?",t3_imr79a

Before long, I noticed they looked a little impatient and kept looking at the front counter where us employees were. I decided to go clean the dining area and asked them how they were doing this evening. 

The dad replies with a scowl “are you gonna give us any menus or what?”. 

“Uh, we’re a Tim Hortons sir, we don’t have menus. You order at the counter.” 

And then they all turn around in their seats and try to read the menus on the screen from where they are sitting. The son complains that he can’t see it. I decide to just tell them what’s available, and they all order a bunch of stuff through me. I go back and punch it all in the system, and tell him from the counter that I’ll need him to come up and pay. 

“But we haven’t received our food yet.” 

“Yes, sir, here you pay when you order..” 

“Well, how do I know what to tip if I don’t know whether the food and service is good? So far I’m not convinced on the service”. 

“Sir, you don’t have to tip.” 

His eyes light up. He comes up and pays and sits back down. An employee makes the food, puts it all on the counter, and calls out the order. They all just turn and look at me. I’m on drive-thru at this point, but they can manage without me for a second, so I carry the trays over to them. The son asks for some pepper. I bring over some little packets of pepper. He says he wants freshly ground. I tell them this is the only pepper I have. As I’m walking away, the mom says “good thing we didn’t tip. Terrible service.”

I had to explain that Caesar is a salad, not a sandwich. She got very irritated and made me go get a menu so she could point at exactly what she ordered.

By that point her friends had clued in and were like um, yes, you got exactly what you ordered, and we were all trying to explain what a Caesar salad was.

All historical and cultural oddities aside, it's one of the busiest days of the year. I am a regional manager of a local chain of three pizza restaurant that are part of a bigger national franchise. 
It's about 9 pm. Very few people are dining in, but the delivery is super busy. Basically new orders have been coming in non stop since 4 pm, three workers are always at the pizza station, and everyone is desperate when 10 pm comes and the store can stop taking orders. A guy enters the restaurant. He has a cellphone in his hand with his camera on and is filming everything. He's in his 50s. With much noise and swearing, he is saying something along the lines of ""you stupid motherfuckers, look at them, there's nobody in this shithole and they can't even deliver the fucking orders in time, idiots"". The store manager (this part of the story I later learned from him) sees this and starts talking to the guy. The guy is obviously a famous blogger , the whole town knows him and we're the stupid motherfuckers who had let him wait 3 hours for his orders. Now we promise delivery within an hour or we give a free pizza. And of course it's busy, and some of the deliveries are late, but not three hours! 80-90 minutes top. And we have a tracking system so we know where all of our drivers are. Three hours is not possible. The guy keeps saying that no, your stupid driver arrived three hours later with a stone cold pizza and said ""guess you don't want it then"". None of ours could've said that. Long story short, after 20 minutes of shouting the guy finally demands that we give him his pizzas and the manager asks the team to make him his two pizzas and the guy leaves but promises to mix us with dirt.
The next day I learn about it. I call the guy.
Hello sir, I'm dulti, the regional manager, please tell me what had happened.
I ordered two pizzas from you idiots! You were three hours late!
Sir, I can't find your phone in the orders list, maybe you used a different phone?
No.
What was the address you wanted it delivered to?
Such and such.
But there's no such and such in my orders list either. Sir, are you sure it was us? 
Of course! I only ever order from you! Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I'm an idiot? Here, my wife was there, she's gonna talk to you.
So the woman takes the phone and without a hi starts swearing at me. She is enraged to the point that she can't keep up a conversation.
The guy takes the phone back.
Sir, what was the number you called to make the order?
It was ***-***.
But sir, we only have a national number which is 8-***-***-**-**, we don't have a local phone, it's impossible.
DO YOU THINK I'M A MORON! IT IS YOUR NUMBER! WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME AN IDIOT! YOU STUPID FUCKS ILL BURN YOUR PLACE DOWN! I'M A WEALTHY PERSON! I CAN BUY ANYTHING! I JUST WANTED A PIZZA! I'M A FAMOUS BLOGGER! YOU WILL BE NOBODIES!
Obviously i know the number he called. Its another chain, local. They're okay but a national holiday is a national holiday. 
In 10 minutes of constant shouting i manage to convince him to call the number he named and ask them the name of the company and that I call him back in 10 minutes if that's okay sir.
He calls back in 5.

Had a couple come in and ask us for a burger. Explained to them that we don't do burgers because we're a taco shop, but there is a burger joint literally 30 feet further up the sidewalk in the same building. They said no, they want a ground beef taco. Now this is a tiny taco shop but we prepped all of our own meat so we didn't do ground beef because it would just be more prep and we did a version of barbacoa instead. I explain that to them and they demand that they want ground beef because every taco place should have ground beef. After a while I managed to get it into their heads that we weren't going to suddenly have ground beef but that we could make them tacos that they would enjoy that had beef in them. So of course they got the tacos, bitched loudly while all our other customers continued to not give a fuck, and didn't tip.

Not entirely out of the norm, we got kids sometimes because their mom shops at Talbots and they needed something a little more conservative, but usually when that happens, the kid is more of a teenager, and actually would fit into our clothes.

This kid is tiny, she'd fit in petites but nothing would look good because it's all cut for adult women, but it's been a slow night. A really slow night. A really, really, really slow night.

So here are two stories on that which I've experienced first hand. (Including a couple of bonus stories)

1. Lines are always long and whatnot, so everyone gets to wait. I had one woman come up to the service counter (where orders are grabbed and taken to seats or taken out), asking me ""do I have to wait in this line for a 0.50¢ Frosty?""
""Yes."" I spoke in such disbelief.
""Really?""
I nod.
She walks away, I figured she went into the line. She left the building.

2. When the deal ends, we get people who understands. This particular moment was one individual, at drive thru, asking for 3 of them, to switch the response was ""we don't have that promotion."", Ended a few weeks ago. She drives around, pulling of, in a newer model dodge charger. My best moment ""that's why she couldn't afford the normal price.""

BONUS 1. Recently, like early in summer, I had the most headache inducing moment in my time there.
""How may I help you?""
""I need a number 6, large with a coke""
""We're all out of coke, is there anything else I can help with?""
""Yes,""
""Okay, how can I help""
""Coke'
""We're out of that. I have diet coke, dr. Pepper, fanta orange.""
""Coke.""
""So a diet coke?""
""No, regular coke.""
""Sir, we're out of Coke! What do you want?!""
He drives off, I Scream aloud in confusion ""AND YOU LEFT WITH NOTHING!""

BONUS 2. My first year, we often got buses. So this time, a big, greyhound looking bus pulls in. I hop on back to help out. At first, we are only getting hit with the drive thru and the few front counter orders. Nothing from the bus.
We peek out, we see one person and feel a small bit of relief.
We spot him wearing a wife brimmed hat, a bit of confusion.

CH: Yo, give me a fuckin' cheeseburger!

Cousin: No. Go away. Bye.

CH: Well, I'm gonna come back and kill you tomorrow.

Probably funnier when she told it. Apparently this wasn't an unusual occurence since she mostly worked nights in a sketchy area. A friend of mine was handed a rolled up bill at the register, and when he unrolled it to put it in the drawer, cocaine fell out.

2341,g4a65ws,t3_imr79a,"For most of college I worked at a grocery store, specifically the salad bar department. We made several types of fruit trays and veggie trays, especially for graduations and stuff. Occasionally we'd get asked to make some weird stuff like melon boats, where we'd scoop out a cantaloupe, honeydew, or watermelon and fill it with other fruits. Other times we'd get asked to make watermelon baby carriages for baby showers. None of those were really in our official catering guide, but YOLO. Whatever looks good and we could charge for.

One of my managers, bless her, straight up told us we were supposed to refuse any orders that were intended to be Edible Arrangements (like they advertise on tv or billlboards). According to her, they cost too much time in prep and materials and were a pain in the ass to to deliver. I gleefully agreed to this.

Still, that didn't stop customers from trying to order them. Every time I got a catering call asking for one, I'd explain that we couldn't do Edible Arrangements, but we could do x, y, and z instead. One lady pressed further.

Lady: But I'd really like an Edible Arrangement! Is there any place I could order one from?

Me: Well, there's one downtown.

Lady: Okay, what is it called?

Me: Uh...Edible Arrangements?

Lady: Seriously? That's what it is called?

Finally they stopped for breath long enough for me to tell them that our company had nothing to do with that cable network and only happened to have similar names.  They then accused me of being part of the cover up and that I was probably racist too.  We weren't allowed to hang up on customers except in particular circumstances.

I finally just put it into a paper cup and handed it to her. The look of relief on her face.... She was asking for the paper cup all along and couldn't say cup or bowl to save her life. 

It should've ended there, but she then tried to pay in a currency not accepted by our store.

2495,g44pvlb,t3_imr79a,"Not fast food, but I do have a story that kind of fits the topic, and the spirit of what everyone is saying. 

I just left a job working for a postal contractor. We took big shipments of stuff and broke them up to make it easier for the post office to handle. I was in charge of shipping and receiving on 2nd shift there. 

The warehouse I was in was gigantic. It used to be a Caterpillar factory, where they made big machines. Now there are 4 different companies in two buildings on site. Ours was small, only 11 doors (out of something like 170), but our address started with 301, just like everyone else in the building.Yet we were better marked than the other companies, so we attracted all the angry truck drivers. 

At least once a day, someone would come in and say, ""Hi, I'm looking for 301"" and I could point them in the right direction. Sometimes, they would come in and say, with a heavy accent, ""Ees thees...uh...three-oh-one?"" We had a lot of drivers who spoke Spanish, but this wasn't an issue because I could grab one of my Puerto Rican co-workers and have them tell the driver where to go. We also had many of the drivers who spoke Russian, or some African language. 

One time I had an extremely old man, like WWII veteran old. He hobbled in with his cane and silently handed me his paper, which was for one of the other companies. I told him where to go, and he just uttered ""fuuuuck..."" in a really low voice as he hobbled back out. Another time, I had a guy come in with a paper for the other company. I started telling him where to go, but he just started screaming at me in Russian. I had to walk outside and actually point at the door, because every time I tried to point at them from our door, I just got screamed at more. 

Some drivers thought that I wasn't giving them a load because I didn't like them. They would show up, I'd tell them where their company was, and they would just be like ""No, this is the right place. Here's the load number."" I had a few guys back in without checking in, and I would have to go outside and chase them away, before they dropped a trailer of stuff we couldn't unload (one time this happened on another shift, and the dock staff actually met with the driver and exchanged paperwork with him, telling him he could drop it there). 

Sometimes a driver would show up around 4 or 5 PM, but his load wasn't scheduled until 7 AM. I'd tell them that the load wasn't going to be ready for over 12 hours, and to bed down in the yard, and they would call their dispatch, who always asked me, ""Is there any way you could load him sooner?"" Nope, you sent him here 12 hours early. 

I just left that job, and I'm thankful I no longer need to deal with angry truckers.",t3_imr79a

I had one stand out case stand out. A person came to the electronics desk with a dirty baseball and asked ""Do you sell these here?"". You could immediately see that this person was not the sharpest tac in the box.

Naturally, I thought they want to buy a new baseball and took them to the sporting goods section. When we got there, they said ""No, do you sell these here?"" holding the baseball up. I noticed a they were showing me a printed signature on the ball. It was clearly one of those baseballs with stamped signatures.

""We sells generic baseballs and a limited quantity of collector baseballs but I don't believe we have that player. You can try Dicks Sporting Goods.""

Guest: ""No, I want to sell this. I want to get money for it.""

Me: (visibly confused) ""Did you buy that here?  We don't accept returns from non-target stores. The returns desk is in the front of the store where you entered. They can give you more details on Target's return policy."" 

Guest: ""No, I want to sell this. How much will you give me for this?""

Me: ""We are not going to buy that from you.""

Guest: ""Why not? You sell these here don't you?""

Me: ""This is a Target, not a Pawn shop.""

At this point, few of my team members were in the next aisle over enjoying my conversation with this guest. They were wondering where I was since I had keys and found me talking to this guest. 

Guest: ""What a Pawnshop?""

I explained what a Pawn Shop was and how they worked.

Guest: ""So how much do you think I will get for this?""

Me ""Probably not much.""

Guest: ""It signed by (I forgot the name). I got it for $500. They said I could sell it for more.""

Me: ""This is a collector's baseball with a stamped signature."" I show the guest one of the few collector balls we had and how the signature wasn't real. ""They produce these by the thousands and sell them a sporting good stores. I doubt a pawn shop will offer anything significant, certainly not $500.""

Guest: ""So where can i sell this then? I want to get money for it.""

By that point the Manager of the store had come over at the request of my teammates and realized the kind of guest we were dealing with. He excused me back to electronic dept and took over. The guest left about 15 min later and the manager came by and told me the code word to get assistance with tough situations like that; apparently this happens often enough to make a code word for it.

Dude comes back probably 30 minutes later somewhat drunk, slurring a little and asks for another pint. I sell him this pint and he pays with slightly more crumpled up tender. Again on his way.

I tell him I can’t sell him anymore in good conscience. Gets angrier and with his best Frankenstein’s monster impression points again to the whiskey. I tell him absolutely not and he’s pissed but stumbles out of the store falling into shit as he goes, leaving me to pick up his random collection of change off the counter. 

About a month later, same dude walks in wearing a really nice expensive looking suit. He’s well trimmed and orders some higher end expensive something or another that I can’t recall.

&#x200B;

* Reservations can only be made for our upstairs area, downstairs is all self-service and we do not make reservations there, we do not make exceptions there and we do not offer table service downstairs, also not by exception
* The upstairs area is reached by two stairs; one spiral and one wider set of stairs.
* There is no elevator or other equipment to get wheelchairs upstairs
* Toilets are located downstairs only
* We do not advice people in wheelchairs to book with us due to this but are happy to make a reservation in one of our 23 other locations in the same city (not kidding, we do have 23 other locations) of which most are very wheelchair friendly

On top of this, I closed produce alone pretty much every night, so I had to cover both because I had some experience with floral from my grandmother owning a flower shop. 

One day, this man comes in around 6pm asking for help with floral, I go to help him and he hands me his cell phone. It’s his wife, who wants me to make “something like a bridal bouquet”.

I go back about my job, now behind because it was the after work rush. It’s coming up on 8pm and I’m getting ready to close down the salad bar when I see a teenager walk up with a fairly large bouquet.

We were slammed and understaffed and our wait time was extremely long even though we were trying our best. 

So this lady was getting really pissed about waiting for her super important order of six shitty tacos, defrosted and assembled by a guy who went to my high school but never actually showed up for class. Every time we would call out an order number, she would sarcastically (and loudly) cheer and clap and “congratulate” us for “finally learning how to do our jobs!” 

This went on for ten or fifteen minutes before I finally showed her our order board and said “here is the order we are currently making, order 15, and waaaaaayyy over here is your order, order 45.” Realizing how many orders were ahead of her finally prompted her to leave (with no tacos) so that we could continue fulfilling orders under the silent watchful gaze of our other thirty angry customers.

“Hello this is Wendy’s”

“Hi this is the such and such police department, how is everything there?”

Police said okay thanks.

Take some more orders, serve some food.

“Is everything okay?”

Uhhhhh yes, why wouldn’t it be?

“Can you walk us to your freezer so we can make sure everything is okay?”

Sure!

They left, we realized what happened, we laughed.

**Fake MexiMelt**

Customize the beef burrito

 – Rice

 – Creamy jalapeño sauce

 – Nacho cheese

 + 3 cheese blend
 
 + Pico de gallo

Microwave for a few seconds when you get home to melt the cheese, maybe with a damp paper towel for steam but not really necessary.

**Fake Double Decker Taco**

This one's more difficult because there's no way to communicate where you want the beans, so I've done two different ways.

1) order a taco or taco supreme, then customize the cheesy bean and rice burrito, removing the cheese and rice, then opening up and pressing it onto the taco.

2) order nacho crunch double stack, remove the nacho cheese and red pepper strips, add pico & sour cream if you like supreme. You can add beans and they'll probably just put it inside the taco unless they've been working there a while and can tell what you're trying to do. Or you can specify on the side and they'll put the taco in the tortilla plain and you can just spread it on with the spork. You get a lot more beans if you order on the side, so if you're planning to eat 2 or 3 you really only need to add the beans to one.",t3_imr79a

Pro tip: It actually *is* corporate policy that any order over a certain number of items (i forget the exact number) MUST be called in at *least* an hour in advance and they have to provide a credit card over the phone. This allows the staff enough time to make the order without having to bring everything else to a grinding half and make everyone in line wait for 45 minutes while you fill this ONE order.

By the letter of Wendy's policy, if someone walks in and tries to order more than... I wanna say 30 items? It might be a different number but yeah, if someone tries to order more than a certain number of items at a time, you are not only allowed to refuse the order, youre actually REQUIRED to refuse the order because the rules clearly state that large orders MUST be called in in advance and CANNOT be taken as normal orders that are expected to be filled then and there, because doing so would cause unfair inconvenience and unacceptable wait times to other customers in line.

Now, sadly, 99.9% of managers will make you take the order anyway because theyre complete fucking idiots and dont give two shits about the employees OR all the customers in line behind the person with the huge order, but if your manager is really, really, REALLY insanely cool they might actually follow the rules on this one if you bring it up.

Also just for the record, this was the policy when I worked there which was nearly a decade ago. I dont know whether it is still part of corporate policy, but its worth a look.


Another thing we'd get is that every few months we'd have a literal BUSLOAD of people come in for lunch or dinner. Usually a school sports team on the way to/from a game or some such, but yeah, having your line go from 2 or 3 people to 2 or 3 DOZEN was not fun.",t3_imr79a

Dude was an absolute dead ringer for Steve-O and took pizzamaking hilariously seriously, even competed in like some... corporate pizza making competition where you see how many medium pepperonis you can make in a certain amount of time. Knew all the world records and shit and was personally close to matching them, made sure every pizza we sent out was fucking awesome, but was absolutely the chillest dude around as long as you didn’t fuck up (hard to do making fast food pizza).

I had some $30/hour nights, usually went home with $50-100 in my pocket for 5 hours of work, then got a few hundred more every couple weeks from my hours. Gas was more than covered, too. I spent the whole shift sitting in my air conditioned car, listening to music, was able to vape, get fresh air, see every part of my city, etc. I also actually enjoyed chatting up customers—and the tips that followed. Get home at 11 with some half-price pizza or whatever, stay up till 5 am, sleep till 2, work at 5, living the life. Driving pizzas is a hell of a job, especially for a college kid and especially the evening shift in a college town (who buys a pizza before 5 pm?). I was on full scholarship, too, so every single buck I made could go to whatever I wanted.

I was hoping for something that people eat even though they hate it just because it’s expected of them for some reason. Maybe we’re not surrounded by as many pretentious assholes as we thought?

I can only conclude that everything is possible to enjoy. You can probably learn to like most things you have a dislike for so go out there and eat some gross looking stuff and learn to love it! Try things with an icky flavor or texture in a new context, you might learn something new about yourself.

2971,gaux3ai,t3_jm76w8,"german psychologist here. in my first year of education we had some lessons about reading gestures and mimic of people we talk to. Summaring you could say we were teached in telling, if the person in front of us is lying. After the lessons i asked my professor for several other situations where you can find out if the person is lying. We came to the result, that the easiest situation to read the gestic would be eating.

for those who dont know: the human species feels save while eating. so while we take the first bite our mimic is completely emotionless. if the food then turns out to be really bad you can see it in slight changes of the facial expression of the person. (ie. slight chin changes or wiggling ears. sometimes a raise of some hairs on the forehead.)

so when you walk across the street and see people eating in restaurants you can see if the people like the food or not. 

in a little chart i made i put datas in of friends of mine and which food turned out to be bad although they said it was perfect.

so just talking about my recipes it turned out that most of my friends dislikes my homemade cookies. 

after being used to read the taste of my friends i tried it on the street by telling people in restaurants if they like the food or not. in 84% of my guessing i was right. i also added the data in a new chart of mine. 

turns out that very much people really dont like a big mac. and i really dont know why.

They might not have grown up with dairy and just think it’s a weird/bad smell, the way some non-Asians think the smell of some of our food can be pretty weird/bad.

My parents like to say Indians smell like spices, Koreans smell like garlic, white people smell like milk.

Surströmming is made from herring caught in spring, and the year's batch is officially released on the market in August. If stored in a refrigerator or cold cellar, it's still perfectly edible another year on, but softer in texture, and some people prefer it that way. By the third year it's just lactic fish soup.

3921,ejb2c08,t3_b53fvi,"Someone else can chime in on whether this pasta dish can help with depression, but here's my ""adulting"" recipe for three bowl pasta (three bowl because you will go back for seconds, and thirds; adulting because I made it up right after college).

* 1 box of Pasta: go with a thicker pasta, like ziti or rigitoni, cook it to the boxes instructions, but save some of the water.  Also, salt the fuck out of your water! People say it should be like sea water, but those people have no idea how much salt is in sea water (it's around 1 cup of salt per gallon of water for sea water). Don't go that hard, but way more than a pinch.
* Onion soup mix.
* Green pepper and red pepper.
* Garlic.
* Olive oil.
* Parmesan Cheese.

Here's the instructions: Start the pasta water.  Chop up the peppers, cut them into long strips.  Heat a pan to a bit past medium. When hot, pour in a tablespoon or so of olive oil, then the peppers. Stir them around occasionally to cook them. At some point your pasta water is boiling (and you have added a lot of salt!) and you can cook the pasta to the box instructions.  Keep at the peppers, when they are less firm, throw in a clove of garlic (minced, I buy the pre-minced kind because I'm lazy).  Whenever you're happy with the peppers, turn them off and remove from heat.  When the pasta is done, get at least 2 cups of the water out, and then strain.

In a big bowl, pour in about 1/4 cup of your pasta water and stir in  the onion soup mix (one packet). Then pour in the pasta and the peppers. This is going to be a thick sauce, probably too thick, so add more of the pasta water until you think it's right. When it's to your liking, plate it up, and allow your guests to add as much cheese as they like.

It all takes about 20 minutes to make, and is really simple.  You can add butter or whatever if you want it creamy.  Throw in some green onions if you feel like.

You can also use onion/mushroom soup mix. That's a bit different, but you do you.

EDIT: I love mushrooms to the point where I have been told I shouldn't recommend them (hence the last line not really recommending them), but I would add a shitton of mushrooms to this about halfway through the pepper cook, sliced thin. If you want the mushrooms to be more earthy, slice them thicker, or bake them really thick, but that's making the dish more involved, and I don't think OP wanted that.",t3_b53fvi

But I would *also* be a little bit worried, and I would want my kid to know that it's not their job to fix, or even help, my mental illness. And I'd want to make sure that they were okay, and not taking on too many responsibilities that they weren't really old enough to cope with. So, since you already have a bunch of good suggestions and recipes in this thread, I'm going to just suggest that you make sure you're looking after yourself as well as your parents, and that you ask for help if you need it.

Fruit salad for breakfast, with yogurt and granola (I like grape nuts, personally, but whatever you/they like). Tea and lots of water. Maybe eggs if you’re feeling up to it. 

Lunch: sandwiches on wheat/multigrain bread - make sure to have veggies on there, lettuce and tomato for a traditional sandwich, but you can get creative here depending on your skill level, lots of water. 

Dinner: a salad kit with the dressing inside makes a pre-dinner salad easy. I like to make Rice a Roni and throw in some chopped up spinach and roasted red peppers with some Italian sausage, but you can put literally anything in there. Load up on the veggies and pick you favorite protein (chicken/ground beef/sausage). SO easy and takes me less than 20 mins to make. 

You got this. Keep it easy. For me and my depression, having a ritual (same breakfast every morning) was so helpful and became important, because it felt like I had something I could rely on.

It is that you are willing to help them in anyway you can. Just be there to talk if they want to talk or just hang out with them and bull shit about the weather or about what the dog did today. Your presence matter that most. You being able to go I want to help you because I care about you THAT is what matters. Make them anything and sit down and eat it with them because being there matters more than anything else. It might be weird at first but as time goes on it will become easier.

Here are some easy recipes for you to have a look at, to round them out chuck in a side of garlic bread and a bag of salad (Taylor Farms do excellent bags o' salad with the crunchy toppings and dressing so it's dead easy and there's zero chopping). These are in regular rotation at our house and are easy and inexpensive to make.

1. One pot mac n cheese - [https://www.budgetbytes.com/miracle-mac-n-cheese/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/miracle-mac-n-cheese/)
2. Carrot and coriander soup   
Take 500g of carrots and boil them. If you have a potato, you could chuck that in to boil as well. Fish the carrots out of the hot water and shove them in to the blender. Blitz until smooth, adding some of the water you used to boil the carrots if needed. Meanwhile, chop around 150g of cream cheese into cube and chuck in a mug. Add enough hot carrot cooking water to make the cheese soften and encourage this process with a fork. Chuck softened cheese and carrot water mixture in to blender and blitz. If you're feeling fancy chuck some garlic in to the mix. Chop up some fresh coriander and chuck in the blender and blitz - alternatively, a couple of pinches of dried coriander from a packet is grand. Optional - crispy bacon on top/ bacon sandwiches on the side. Nom nom nom.
3. Fishcakes - you can sub out the maltzo meal for bog standard breadcrumbs and the salmon for tuna. They are a bit fiddly but yummy and they freeze well. [https://www.nigella.com/recipes/salmon-fishcakes](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/salmon-fishcakes)

I’ll give some easy bare-bones ideas though if you wanna actually take time to cook. I recommend looking up actual recipes though if you wanna try these, because I don’t wanna make a visually overwhelming post with super intricate instructions haha

**Chicken Parmesan**
Boil a big pot of water. Bread and fry chicken breasts with Italian bread crumbs (I buy mine from target) in a separate on, pour your chosen spaghetti or marinara sauce on the bottom of a casserole dish, put the fried chicken breasts in it, top with a bit more sauce and sprinkle lots of mozzarella and/or Parmesan cheese. I like using mozz more. As that’s baking, you should cook some spaghetti noodles. Drain the noodles and after the chicken is done, you serve the noodles, spoon out some of the sauce from the dish on top of the noodles, and top with the super crispy chicken breast that has all this melty cheese on top. It’s super good and very easy if you’re new to cooking!!

**Beef Stew**
If you have a crockpot, this is even easier than the last. Go out and buy some beef stew tips (should be by the other packaged meat), carrots, red potatoes, and other veggies you like. Onions maybe! I don’t like mine with onions lol. Campbell’s makes pre-made beef stew sauce in packets like [this](https://www.campbells.com/sauces/slow-cooker-sauces/beef-stew-sauce/) and it literally has the instructions on this packet. It’s really easy. Throw the beef in, top that with the veggies, and then pour this on top. 4h on high or 8h on slow :) 

**Potato Soup**
A vegetarian option if you or your family does not like meat, but this dish is super customizable where you can add in pretty much anything you want. Bacon, carrots, celery, onions, cheddar cheese, whatever you’d like. For the sake of being quick though I’ll just explain with *only* potatoes. 

Peel, dice to bite size chucks, and boil 5-7 golden potatoes. Put the potatoes in the water before you boil though so they can start to cook as the water temp gets hotter. Once the potatoes feel soft enough by poking with a fork (or even eating a bite), drain half of the water and add in your choice of milk. I grew up with regular 2% but my boyfriend is vegan so we use unsweetened almond milk. Add in instant mashed potato flakes slowly. I know this sounds bad but it makes the broth/soup part thicker and tastes better. Just add in a bit and stir it, add in a bit more, and stir it until you’re happy with the consistency so you don’t end up with...well...mashed potatoes lol. I add in butter (again, your choice) and season with whatever I’m feeling that day. Usually salt and pepper, onion powder, celery salt, white pepper, and chives. My bf adds red pepper flakes and his vegan sour cream. 

These should all be pretty easy! Otherwise, dude, just go out and get a rotisserie chicken and some Bob Evans mashed potatoes hahaha. They’ll love the hell out of you.

Well, this will all depend on your skill level, what you may have in your kitchen for equipment (electric skillet, crockpot/instapot, etc.), and ingredients available. This can help open some new avenues.

First off, feel free to PM me for recipes. I have a ton that are quick and easy to make, and don't break the budget.

Let's start at the ""Ummm...I can cook instant ramen...?"" and low budget. Not meaning to assume anything, but just starting with a level comfortable for just about anyone.

Easy Mode Spaghetti and Meatballs. Literally 5 uncomplicated ingredients, and two pots, two spoons, and an oven. 

1x box of spaghetti (I prefer thin, but I would just choose one they like) ~$1

1x large jar of sauce (Ragu Meat is a good one, they usually have the large one on our near the bottom shelf) ~$2-4

1x bag of frozen meatballs (my apologies to fellow cooks and Italian grandmothers; I would go for Italian style, as they tend to have more flavor than just the standard) ~4-6

Bag or jar of grated Parmesan and/or Romano Cheese. Better ones are in the cheese section, usually in the deli area. ~$2-4

Loaf of Italian bread ~$1-2

Bam! Dinner for ~$10-15. And that's assuming you don't already have any of the ingredients already.

First, preheat oven to 350°F/175°C.

Dump your sauce into a decent sized saucepan, plop in your frozen spheres of meaty goodness, of which I might do 3-4 a person, depending on their size. Put it on the stove at about medium high heat with a cover (or splatter screen, if you have one) until it starts bubbling. Then reduce it to low, and set a timer for 20 mins, and let those meatballs jacuzzi it up, stirring occasionally so they can mingle. 

At this point start getting a pot of water boiling for your pasta. Once you get to about the 10 minute mark on your timer, drop in your pasta, and cook according to directions on box. If the time is shorter, just drop in when they should both be done. 

Now, get your Italian bread. We're gonna give give him a nice tent for his trip to Ovenland. Get two pieces of foil, one under and one over the bread, and crimp the edges together. This helps to keep the moisture in so it doesn't dry out. Put in oven for those 10 minutes.

Beeeeep! Timer goes off.

Get bread out of oven, unwrap. Turn off burners, remove from the heat, then drain your noodley awesomeness in your holy colander headwear (r'amen!), and you're ready to plate. Get your plates and get your desired amount of pasta on there. Next get your pasta and meatballs on there. Sprinkle your cheese on meatball mountain, and that is one tasty, low stress dinner for you and your parents.

Again, hit me up if you want ideas. Got a ton of them.

For dinner I might make him a steak in the broiler (hard to screw up) with some sliced onions and mushrooms cooked in a saute pan with butter, plus salt and pepper. 

For either of my parents sometimes I would just make some rice and server it with some canned black bean soup that I heated up.

French toast can be nice any time of day, comforting, and good for people who like something sweet when they are felling low.

If you're interested in any more details on how to make these, let me know.

But all that aside, understand that comforting someone who is sad or cheering them up is not the same thing as dealing with someone with depression. Depression is not just like being really sad, it's a whole different issue, and one better handled by healthcare professionals. It's like the difference between someone with a little cut that anyone can help with (antibiotic ointment, bandaid) and having a broken leg or a collapsed lung. While being supportive to a certain extent is good, treating depression or really caring for someone with it - especially a parent when you yourself are not an adult - is too much to ask. Leave the heavy lifting to the professionals.

You should not feel like you have to take care of your parent, talk to someone at school you trust or maybe another adult - the parent of a friend for instance, and let them help you help your parent.

For starters, I use an aluminum pan sized 10 1/4"" x 12 1/2"" and 3 1/2"" deep. You can use a 9x13 baking dish, just understand you'll have extra elements leftover, and when I use a 9x13 baking dish, my lasagna is only two layers instead of three.

Lasagna Filling: 

1. 1 box of lasagne noodles (12 oz) - uncooked (which is why this is so easy)
2. 1 jar of marinara sauce (907 oz or 2 lbs)
3. 1 lb of ground beef
4. 1 medium onion, chopped
5. 2 garlic cloves, minced (I just use the pre-minced stuff)
6. Dried herbs - oregano, basil (1 t. each)

Cheese layer/filling:

1.  8 oz mozzarella (I shred it myself, but you can purchase pre-shredded)
2. 2 C. Ricotta cheese
3. 2 C. Cottage cheese
4. 2 eggs, beaten
5. 1/2 C. Parmesan cheese
6. 2 T. dried parsley flakes
7. 2 t. salt
8. 1/2 t. pepper

Make sure your baking dish is clean (you can use a 9x13 pan, just understand that you'll need another baking dish because this recipe makes a lot of food).

In a frying pan on your cook-top, over medium heat, cook the meat & onion until the onion is soft and the meat is browned. Add the garlic. When the garlic is lightly browned, just a minute or two, remove frying pan from heat, set aside.

In a medium sized bowl, combine Ricotta cheese, cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley flakes, salt, pepper. Mix well.

Now you're going to build the lasagna. This lasagna has three layers of each item, so keep that in mind as you start because you'll want enough of each element for the three layers.

Place three uncooked noodles at the bottom of the baking dish of your choice. Put down a layer of the cheese filling, spread on top of the noodles. Next is a layer of shredded mozzarella, then the meat sauce. Put another layer of uncooked noodles (for the aluminum pan, it'll be four uncooked noodles, they may slightly overlap), then the cheese filling, followed by mozzarella, and another layer of the meat sauce. Another layer of four, uncooked noodles, cheese filling, mozzarella, and the last layer of meat sauce. 

If you are making this a day ahead, cover with aluminum foil and place in fridge.

Baking - bake uncovered in a 375 degree oven. If you use the aluminum baking dish, it will need to cook for an hour and a half or until the internal temperature is 150 degrees. If you are using the 9x13 baking dish, it should be finished in about an hour, or until the internal temperature is 150 degrees. Allow to cool for 15 minutes before eating. 

If you want to make it a complete meal, purchase a bagged salad kit and a baguette. :)

Next, so many things! If you have a slow cooker, it's nice because you don't need much time to throw all ingredients in, and the house starts to smell amazing for HOURS, which can life spirits.
Also, can be nice to do stuff which is easy but hands on. Make a pizza, roll some cinnamon buns, etc. It's a chance to invite the parent to spend some time with you two, and using your hands can be great stress relief.
There are some recipes that take a long time but just require some periodic attention. Set yourselves up with a movie while you have a chili or soup on the stove for a couple hours. Easy to pause every 20-30 minutes so you can talk about the movie while you give it a stir. Or marathon a sitcom that gives you a he same kinda breaks. (Shoutout for One Day at a Time on Netflix. A kickass Cuban mother, grandmother, and kids. Beautiful comedy that doesn't pull any punches with dealing with real world issues, including the mom's depression, but deals with everything bravely and with a smile.)
Whatever you cook, I'm sure they will love, as long as you are happy making it. It doesn't have to be fancy, it just has to bring a smile to your face while you are taking over the reins for a bit in the kitchen.

Healthy, wholesome food is best. Avoid things with too much bread, we get enough of that anyway. Avoid processed foods. Something with a lot of veggies like the soup works well. 

If you wanted to try other things you can see if kefir has any effect. Probiotics are found to improve mood so you can give it a go.

Healthy fats, protein, and green vegetables will provide nutrition, tasty goodness, but most importantly in this case... Energy and alertness. When you're feeling depressed these little bursts of energy and clarity can mean the world.

Example of a fucking tasty salad that takes 25 mins to make (mostly cooking time for chicken, everything else basically comes out of a package):

* spinach or arugula. I prefer arugula! 
* chicken breast (you can roast a few in the oven in a pan)
* a small amount of berries. They're a good source of fibre. I like blackberries!
* some kind of nut like almond, walnut or pecan. Or, dry roasted edamame! 
* a few slices of avocado
* you can make your own vinaigrette. There's so many options! I love using olive oil, lemon juice, a small dollop of honey and salt and pepper!
* soft goat cheese sprinkled on top
* I like tossing in a few halved cherry tomatoes for colour 

This recipe is high in fibre, protein, healthy fats and you got yer greens with the spinach. You're not just feeding your tummy, you're feeding your brain with these kinds of foods!

depression is a chemical imbalance that requires a chemical cure to have any lasting effect. that being said, you asked what to cook to help, not to cure, meaning your answer is literally anything. the effort alone is what may have an uplifting effect on your ""parents"". 

maybe I'm wrong and seem like a dick. or maybe I'm right and even if I'm not, I'll never not call somebody out on there bullshit if i think there is bullshit to be called out. letting people sit in their own imaginary diapers is a shitty thing to do. not everyone has had a grounding force in their lives and some people manage to surround themselves with yes folk meaning the only people left to save them are people like me, people who don't mind looking like an asshole in their effort to knock a dumb shit out of the magic bouncy castle.

Guaranteed to stimulate their mood, at least in the short run. 

Save on grocery bills.

Save on toothpaste. 

Home will likely be thoroughly cleaned multiple times a day. And night. 

They may qualify early for a seniors discount at many restaurants based on looks alone. 



Cons: 

Dangerous to cook. You may or may not burn your house down 

Highly illegal. 

Chronic dependance to the point of obsessive behaviors. For example always checking the carpets for residue but mostly smoking lint, hairs, dead skincells and dust mites. 

Skin legions. 

Paranoia and hallucinations. Does your dad possess any firearms? At some point he will likely have a shootout with neighbors that are out to get him, or imaginary mutated hamsters sent by the CIA.

4075,ejb6esw,t3_b53fvi,"I'm gonna go with ""super easy"" here, assuming this teenager is someone who hasn't really cooked before:

Get some chicken breasts, either pound (covered) or slice them so they're kind of thin. Cut off the gristly/fatty (white) bits if you can.

Heat up a frying pan with like 2 tablespoons of butter. Set the burner at around 75% heat -- you don't want it too hot. Wait for the butter to melt.

Dip the chicken into ~4 raw eggs you've mixed/stirred in a bowl (so the yolk and white blend), then dip them into a second bowl full of breadcrumbs. 

Put the chicken into the pan and cook it until it's kinda golden-brown. Cut one open if you're unsure about it being done. It should be white all the way through. A meat thermometer is a good thing to have, but I don't think it's necessary for something like this.

This is the first thing I ever learned how to cook, it's very easy and has all those comfort food elements -- salt, fat, warmth. 

Optionally, get some jarred pasta sauce and some mozzarella cheese to melt on top. That gives you chicken parm. Throw it on some quality toasted bread and you've got yourself a chicken parm sammich.

They also have those ""steam in a bag"" microwavable vegetable bags. Some are just plain veggies but they have plenty that are pre-seasoned and such and they're actually really good. Just throw them in the microwave and you're done.

Heat a bit of butter in a big pot. Chop an onion or 2 and cook until translucent. Add some chopped celery and carrots, how much depends on how much soup you want. Cook them for a few minutes, add some minced garlic if you have it or garlic powder works as well.

Add salt, pepper, and thyme. I don't measure the thyme I just sort of dump some into the palm of my hand, shrug, and toss it in.

Add a couple spoonfuls of flour to the vegetables and stir it up. It'll be kind of pastey. That's what you want. Add enough chicken brother to cover the vegetables and then some and then add a few chicken breasts. How many again depends on how much soup you want. Make sure the chicken is fully submerged and bring to a boil, then allow to simmer for like 30 minutes ish. 

Remove the chicken breast once it's cooked and chop into bite sized pieces. Add back into the pot. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Add the juice of one lemon.

You can serve it just like this or with rice, egg noodles, or dumplings.

To make dumplings mix 2 cups flour with 1 tablespoon baking powder, 2 tablespoons oil, 1.5 teaspoon salt, 1 cup warm water.

2) separately, slice 3 leeks and 300g of white grapes (slice the grapes in half) 
3) once the chicken is cooked for the above states time remove from pan and put aside. In the pan used for the chicken add the leeks and grapes. Also, add 300ml of chicken stock. 
4) let the leeks etc soften for a 3 minutes then remove and add to an oven proof dish.

6) put in oven at 200 degrees Celsius (sry don’t know the Fahrenheit) for 25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. 
7) serve and enjoy

4089,ejb9gfy,t3_b53fvi,"Basic tacos are easy. For less than $10 you can get a pound of meat (ground turkey is cheaper and healthier than beer), premixed taco seasoning, tortillas, and lettuce. You may need more for the full experience but there’s a chance you may have it (salsa, sour cream, cheese, hot sauce, etc) already in your fridge or cabinet. It’s easy; just follow the instructions on the packet and everything else can be assemble-your-own. It’s one of the first meals I made my parents to help give them a night off. 

After that, a basic spaghetti sauce isn’t hard; one small jar of canned  sauce, one small jar of canned tomato paste, half pound to a pound of beef and/or sausage, and a half pound to a pound of pasta gives you enough food for 4. Brown the beef, add the sauce and paste as well as a cup of water (or red wine if you have it, highly recommended). Heat til it thins (or until the wine cooks off). Meanwhile heat up the pasta. Add oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, and crushed red pepper to the sauce. Combine. It’s easy and good. Once you master that, you can heat up diced garlic and onion before you brown the meat. 

Finally, if you have the cooking skill or the patience to follow a recipe and let something simmer (on a Sunday perhaps, or on a school holiday), and a large (we’re talking 2-3 gallon) pot, it’s really easy to make a damn good chili. Find some recipes on the internet. Nothing in it is too expensive especially if you buy canned beans and tomatoes. Some of the spices may be hard to find or expensive but the beauty of chili is that no single spice is 100% necessary. Really helps give you the theory behind cooking too; the more you do it, the better you’ll get at the prep and helping to balance the spices and heat (don’t make it too hot the first time!).

When my roommate was getting over depression one thing we sometimes did was make your own pizza night.

Our kids seem to have little interest in spending time with us after dinner, and when it comes to prepping, cleaning, and being exhausted because we're putting on the façade of being completely okay when you guys run off to your rooms to ignore us, it's an added feeling of failure that you don't think we want to you nearby for the rest of the night.

I miss my kids being little and wanting to do everything with us. The smiles on your faces when you just were so excited to see us. You grow up and you're independant. 

Yes, when you gained your independence, we were excited to get some sleep back, but it's not because we don't want to spend time together, but kids are a LOT of energy. Now that we have energy back, we would do anything to reconnect that feeling again. ",t3_b53fvi

Get a pound of beef, 93% lean. 
Salt, Pepper, Ground Red Pepper, Garlic Powder, and powdered taco seasoning. 
1 small lime. 
A can of rotel that fits your liking. 
Cheese
Anything else you like on Tacos. 

But the uncooked beef in a bowl, squeeze half a lime over it. 

Take a quarter cup measuring spoon or equivalent, cover the bottom with salt and then pepper. Then about 2 dashes of ground red pepper and 3 dashes of garlic powder. Add to meat bowl and mix it all together. 

Side Note: A dash of Cinnamon isn't a bad idea either. 

Cook in a saucepan with butter or equivalent. Once meat is mostly brown drain the rotel then add it to the pan. Stir to evenly distribute the rotel. Add the taco seasoning dry by sprinkling the package over the meat equally, then add about 3/4 of the Rotel can filled with water. I usually find this to be too spicy so I throw some cheese in at this point. 

Let bubble on a medium heat, 6-7 usually being the safest, for a little bit uncovered so the water evaporates and the seasoning gets into the flesh of the veggies and meat.


Trust in yourself with this recipe, you actually cannot stir this too often and thats why I rely on this often. Serve as preferred, tortillas or over a salad.

4125,ejbd6pa,t3_b53fvi,"Ingredients:

1 or 2 chicken breast cutlets (depending on how hungry you are), 
1 jar pasta sauce (I like Ragu), 
1 tube pillsbury breadsticks or crescents (the garlic flavored ones are my favorite but any kind will work), 
1.5 cups shredded mozzarella, 
.5 cup Parmesan (grated or crumbled in the shaker thing), 
.5 stick butter, 
Olive oil, 
Italian seasoning (buy or make by mixing dry parsley, basil, oregano), 
Salt and pepper to taste

Start your oven to 350.

Heat a frying pan on low for a few minutes, then add olive oil. Wait another few minutes. Take your chicken breast and cut it into bite size pieces (if your chicken breast is frozen, microwave for 2-3 minutes until it can be cut.) Throw your chicken into the pan and sprinkle Italian seasoning on it. Flip the chicken around until all the pink is gone, then turn off your burner. If there’s any water in the pan. Put a paper towel in the pan to absorb the water.

Pour your jar of pasta sauce into a casserole dish. Then add the chicken and then top with all your mozzarella.

Melt your butter by cutting it up a bit, putting it in a bowl with a napkin over top, and microwaving for intervals of 15 seconds until melted. Once melted, add another dash of your Italian seasoning. Next, take the breadsticks/crescents and rip into roughly 1-inch sections. Dip each piece into the butter mixture and then layer to cover your entire casserole. 

Top your casserole with your Parmesan and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes, or until your breadsticks look fully baked.

Serve with a large spoon into bowl. I usually buy a loaf of Italian bread to go with this but totally not necessary. 

(Best part about this dish is everything is approximate. Only have 3/4 of a jar of sauce sitting in the fridge? That works! Only have 1 cup of mozzarella? No big deal! These are the measurements I like best, but adapt the recipe to what’s in the house! Even if you don’t have breadsticks, cook the chicken, sauce and cheese, and serve with bread or even on a roll as a sandwich! No need to buy anything :) )

Lastly, remember that you are doing a great job. Helping your parents when they are not at a stage to help themselves is an amazing thing to do. I was lucky enough to have a very involved dad growing up who attempted to buffer me from my moms depression, but this meal was always comforting and something I could pull together after school if I knew they had a rough week. They will appreciate any effort you make, regardless of how well your dish turns out! (I used to insist on making soup or chili and it literally never turned out right but it was still easier for my mom to fix than making a whole dish herself, and she always got a chuckle out of my frazzled-failed chef attempt.) Good luck to you and your parents!! 

On a side note: someone else suggested chicken pot pie and I really love that idea too! I often get some from a local butcher, they’re about $7 each and taste completely homemade!",t3_b53fvi

4130,ejbdgp8,t3_b53fvi,"From listening to a researcher by the name of Dr. Rhonda Patrick on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast, brassica family vegetables and blueberries have been shown to have some effect in combatting depression. 



Brassica family vegetables have two molecules called myrosinase and glucoraphinin, which form an anti inflammatory molecule called sulforophane. Broccoli sprouts have the highest concentration of these molecules. Broccoli and kale are a lot easier and cheaper to get your hands on, and these also have a decent amount of these molecules. If you choose to cook these vegetables in a pan (sauté), one of the molecules (myrosinaise) deteriorates, but can be replaced by adding ground mustard seed. I don’t know how much mustard seed to add. Also I recommend butter or some kind of fat to make these vegetables edible.

About a cup of blueberries a day may help with depression. I don’t really know the mechanism.


Also getting consistent sleep is extremely important for brain functioning. There is another Joe Rogan Podcast where Joe interviews a sleep researcher. ",t3_b53fvi

You need to take care of yourself first. It took me years to figure that out. You aren't responsible for your parent becoming not depressed. You haven't done anything wrong. And when you try to make them happy and they remain the same, you have not failed at all. 

You are the child and they are the parent, if anyone is taking care of anyone, it should be them taking care of you. You are not responsible for your parent's feelings or emotional state. Parent-child is not a friend-friend relationship. It's not good parenting for them to be dumping their emotions on their child.

Trying to make a depressed person happy is like shoving emotional energy into a black hole. It isn't going to stop being a black hole because of what you do, you'll never see that energy you spent anywhere else again, and you'll just get frustrated and angry at yourself because nothing is changing.

You need to make sure you make yourself happy and are on solid ground first. It's like when an airplane depressurizes, you need to put your oxygen mask on first before you help the people sitting next to you.

Personally what's helped me a lot is exercise + Vitamin D + making sure I'm getting enough potassium and magnesium. I take supplements for those. For foods, spinach has a lot of minerals.

Here are some Easy recipes I use in college a lot (might not be suitable for you but idk your cooking level)

Sausage pasta.

 Buy some Italian sausage and chop it up to whatever thickness you want. Season it with some cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, garlic, and whatever else you have that sounds good. Add some chopped peppers and you're golden. (Remember that the sausage cooks faster than the peppers so add them later). Throw some fresh mozzarella in there if you're feeling cheesy.

Boil some pasta (any shape). As the pasta is finishing add some sauce to the sausage concoction and let it heat up (I like getting the fresh stuff, choose whatever blend you want honestly) 

Stir it all together and serve with a salad and red wine. 







Burgers are easy. Kale chips, broccoli, brusselsprouts are an easy side. Salad with chicken is easy.

The year before I moved to a different state because I needed to pursue my own life, I learned to make a basic Thanksgiving dinner, and went to her house and cooked it for her. It was kind of an awful experience for me because she was a hoarder and her house was filthy, but having her daughter come and make her what felt like a normal Thanksgiving dinner was special.

After I moved, I did a lot of baking and when I had to enter her into assisted living and up until the end of her life, I would send her baked goods. I had recipes she'd sent me when I moved away, treasured recipes, and I made them and sent them to her. When I cleaned up her house to sell it, I found her cherished Christmas cookie recipes. When I went home, I baked them and sent them to her.

My recommendation is think on what you shared with your parents. What they liked. What they wanted. What was special. Make it for them. Healthy is great, and I recommend trying to do rounded meals, but I'd also recommend foods that evoke memories of better times. Smell and taste are very much linked with memory. If there was something special when things were better, find the recipe and make it.

If I'd made my mom recipes from when I was a kid, I would have ended up making stir fry with frozen peas and chopped hot dog since we were poor. But making her special pumpkin bread recipe made her happy and reminded her of when she made it when she was younger and talked about when she made it.

Sweat the onion and garlic in a med-hot pan with oil or butter. Add some ground beef if available. Golden brown, no pink. Carefully pour out the watery fat. Lower the heat for the rest. Then sauce - a couple $2 jars.  Give it some time to gently heat up and fill the kitchen. Taste-test often, and add pinches of salt. Not too much. If there are herbs available go with basil, thyme, oregano, and marjoram in very light dustings, and no particular order. Garlic is also welcome. Let em melt into the sauce.  

Boil a big thing of salty water, add any pasta, and stir every minute for 8-10 mins. Carefully pour out the boil water.  

Fill bowls halfway with pasta, and drown with sauce.

What you'll need:
Boneless skinless chicken, about half a pack, thighs or breasts, dealers choice
8 oz blob of fresh mozzarella
Fresh basil (it's way better fresh)
A small thing of cherry tomato
A yellow onion
2 cloves of garlic
Salt and pepper
Pasta (dealers choice on shape, I like penne

What you do: 

Chop the onion, cut the tomatos in half and finely chopped the garlic, cut the basil into ribbons (easy as hell, see https://youtu.be/BVGanymmUpA). Also cut the cheese into 1/4"" cubes. Set all that separated on a platethese. Then cut the chicken into pieces slightly smaller than your pasta.

Boil water, throw in a bit of salt, cook pasta however the package says.

While you're doing this heat a pan at medium high heat with a small amount of oil. get some salt and pepper on your chicken then throw it in the pan. Cook through ( just cut a piece open and keep going if there's any pink). Once cooked throw the chicken in whatever you're serving it in.   Don't clean the pan. Just throw in the onion, cook until it's starting to get translucent (like 3 minutes). Throw in the garlic then 20 seconds(ish) later, throw in the tomatos. Once they start losing water, throw in like half of the fresh basil. Cook another 3-5 minutes. Then just dump everything together including the drained pasta, the cheese and the rest of the basil in the serving bowl and stir it up. It's ready when the cheese is stretchy.

4201,ejbo23n,t3_b53fvi,"I suffer from depression. The store and cooking are so difficult. Here are some ideas that sound good to me. These ideas are based on what sounds good to me when I’m depressed but also things that are hearty and homemade, but don’t take a lot of prep or fancy cooking skills. Also, they are dishes that tend to do well as leftovers. Also, the things smell good while cooking. 

Not sure if you were looking only for ideas or need some tips. I am not sure of your cooking skill. I am including some tips, just in case. 

Spaghetti with meat sauce: brown some ground beef. You can add some veggies like mushrooms or green peppers or a can of sliced olives in with the meat after the meat is done cooking. Cook the veggies. Then dump a jar or two of sauce into it and voila. Boil some noodles. 

Do you have a crockpot? A pot that can go in the oven? Even a metal pan with foil on it. Pot roast is always a winner: get a slab of meat at the store, a bag of mini carrots, some mini potatoes, dump it all in a pan/pot/crock pot. For easiness, get a mix that says “pot roast.” There is a section of the store that has flavoring packets for all sorts of things. They have pot roast. You add water, and slow cook it for awhile. The instructions will be on that packet and also will have to do with the weight of the meat. Google cooking time for roasts. 

-a twist on the roast... I came across a recipe for a “Mississippi Roast.” It sounds weird but it is delicious. It calls for a packet of hidden valley ranch, a packet of gravy mix, and a jar of pepperocini peppers. I just used some of the juice for the peppers. This was for a 3-4 lb roast. If you are doing a smaller one, add less seasoning. Sounds weird but it is delicious. 

Chili: back to the ground beef. In that same section of the supermarket, you will see mixes for chili. There are a lot of them. Take your pick. They will have instructions on what else to get (tomato paste, canned diced tomatoes, beans, etc.) and how to cook it. It will require some browning of ground beef and then some dumping of stuff in a pot and then letting things cook for awhile and letting all the flavors meld. 

Beef stew: basically browning chunks of beef instead of ground beef, same flavor profile as pot roast. Takes less time to cook because the meat is in chunks. Also, can be done on the stove. 

A personal favorite: tuna casserole. I use tuna that comes in water. I dump that (with the water) in a large pot and heat it up. I add cream cheese, some milk, various cheeses, salt and pepper, some frozen veggies, and taste it until it tastes good. Maybe a little salty. Then I boil noodles. I mix the two together and dump it in a baking pan. Put some bread crumbs and tabs of butter on the top and bake it at 350 until it is crispy and bubbly. You can do this with canned chicken or any leftover meat. Casserole is just some creamy meat concoction with a smattering of vegetables and a crispy topping (which is the best part so go crazy there.)

In the frozen section at my grocery store, they sell frozen boneless turkeys with gravy packets. You can cook them frozen. They cook up really nice. So, you would just have to whip up some sides. 

Chef salads are always nice if you are feeling healthy... then you can make them not healthy... get cherry tomatoes and carrot shreds and maybe a cucumber, maybe an avocado. Then buy some turkey and ham and some cheese. 

If you have leftover ground beef, I love a taco salad. 

Those are just some ideas off the top of my head. I can certainly come up with more.

Recipes my son enjoys cooking:

- Making sushi rolls. It’s a “mindful” meal because there are lots of small steps that need focus and practice. Don’t worry if your first try is a mess ;)

- Spaghetti bolognaise. Chop an onion, fry with some mixed herbs. Crush in a clove of garlic or put in a half t-spoon of garlic salt. Add some diced bell peppers (not chilli peppers!) or mushrooms if you like them. Fry off some ground beef in a separate pan (about half a pound), drain the fat and then add to the onions (and peppers). Add a can of chopped tomatoes (with the tomato sauce) and a box of passata (or other tomato purée). Use less if it’s concentrated. Add a dissolved stock cube if you want extra flavour. Simmer for 20 minutes. 
Bring a pan of water to the boil, add a spoon of salt and glug of oil. Boil the spaghetti (or other pasta shapes) until they’re cooked. Drain and serve with the sauce and some grated cheese. 

Other recipes to look up:

- Tarka dhal. A simple Indian lentil-based curry. It’s a bit like making porridge. I love it. Lots of good proteins in the lentils. https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/lentils-and-basic-tarka-dhal-recipe/

- Thai curry. You can buy a red curry paste and make it as mild or spicy as you like. 

- Chicken fajitas. Lots of chopping and eating food with your hands is the best kind of eating. 

- This pork one-pot is one of my son’s favourite to cook. He loves spending time chopping the fresh finger into tiny little match-stick pieces. It tastes outstanding. https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3014/chinese-pork-onepot

It's the other way around. Tell your parents about your issues and let them figure it out for themselves. Once you've passed the 30 years old mark would I even consider talking about the depression.

You're a great person, obviously your parents have done so well in raising you. Best thing you can do at 19 is figure out where to go from here. You're at an awkward age where our parenting role changes to be somewhat coaching instead. We can't and won't give you all the answers anymore at that stage. It's up to you to make your choices. If you're doing well, we're doing well.

If you insist then cooking breakfast can help a great deal. Just boil some eggs or bake them, put them on toast with some butter. Starting the day is a bitch when dealing with depression. Eating properly in the morning sets us up for a good day even when we don't have the energy to make it.

4246,ejbza89,t3_b53fvi,"Everyone is acting like this is going to go perfectly. Here's another perspective. If she is suffering from depression, she isnt going to feel better knowing that you want to help and feel you need to take care of her. She may respond something like ""oh that's so sweet. you're the sweetest kid ever..."" yadda yadda. 

But believe me when she is alone, theres a good chance she falls deeper into depression. Because the next thoughts are ""jesus christ I'm such a worthless piece of shit that I cant even take care of my own child. They have to waste their time taking care of me, instead of living their life. I cant do anything right, I've fucked up my kid, I cant even be a strong productive parent, I'm the worst role model, it's my fault. Everything is my fault.""

Your intentions are noble, but maybe dont let on that you want to do something to help her out. Act as though you're doing it for you, and it helps her as a side benefit. Otherwise she may feel too much guilt to appreciate it or take advantage of the extra time she has to relax and get her mind right. Like maybe you want to learn to cook, so you're gonna cook dinner once a week, and hey that leaves some extra time for mom to relax a bit. But if she knows that you're so worried about her and feel as though you need to take care of her, she may get more depressed. On the other hand I guess it could give her the realization that she needs to get her mind right and see a psychiatrist or therapist, but I would never take that bet. ",t3_b53fvi

Proper care always helps but I'd suggest making some Salmon or other fatty fish.  Go for something that is wild caught instead of farmed.  I prefer something like Sockeye which costs a bit more than Keta but Keta is also known as dog or chum salmon since people in Alaska usually don't eat it.  Keta's a very lean salmon and low in fat which also makes it a poor choice for Omega 3.  A lot of people may not like the strong taste that salmon may have but if you cook it right you really don't notice.  I've made [this recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQuyOwNtAVM) a few times and it always turns out pretty well.

Meals that are easy to digest are great. Focus on vegetables and fruit, it's crucial to get enough vitamins and minerals in.
Sugar can be fine in small doses (a bit chocolate perhaps) but should be generally avoided. No soda, keep the desserts at bay. While sugar makes you momentarily happy, having too much of it in your blood stream will just make you feel even nore drained than you are already.

I remember when my depression was at its worst, my sense of taste changed. I couldn't eat potatoes for several years because to me each and every one of them tasted rotten. I decided to go for rice with steamed vegetables instead.

While instant food like ramen or ravioli is a go-to favorite for getting the job done fast and easy, the amount of sodium usually is too high for daily consumption.
I found that making ramen yourself was just as easy, and if you make the broth yourself you can easily cook a huge pot and freeze the rest in several tupperware containers.

Unless vegetarian or vegan, a general rule i liked was fish > meat. Nothing too fancy either, but fish has several great nutrients. Plus, not having an iron deficiency is pretty neat.

Now, and I can't stress this enough, make sure the person drinks enough water.
Before I lose everyone's attention: no, of course drinking water isn't the solution to everything, and it certainly won't cure depression. But it does make a real difference. When properly hydrated, the body definitely struggles less with doing its job.

If you don't take care of your physical health, your mental health gets worse. If your mental health gets worse, you won't have any energy to take care of yourself. It's a black hole.

4275,ejc4t35,t3_b53fvi,"Hey there! Here's a quick go-to meal, take around 10-15 minutes.  


PORK NOODLES

1. Get some pork. I normally use pork shoulder, but pork loin should work fairly well too.
2. Get a frying pan and put it on a medium-high heat. 
3. Add a knob of butter (I never measure it, but you're looking to cover the whole frying pan and still have a bit of melted butter sloshing around at the bottom). 
4. Add a clove of chopped garlic (or, if you're as lazy as me, get it pre-chopped in the supemarket and add a teaspoon or more - I love garlic so I add loads!)
5. Optional: Add 1/2 cup of soy sauce. I'm not a fan, but this was in the original recipe so take it or leave it.
6. Add your pork shoulder to the pan and cover with your pan lid. Depending on the thickness of your shoulder, you'll want to leave it here on a medium-high heat for around 5 minutes.
7. After five minutes, boil the kettle and flip the pork on to the other side. Set a timer for another 5 minutes on the pork.
8. In a new pan/pot, add boiling water and chicken stock. I don't know if you'll have this where you are but I use the [Knorr Chicken Stock Pots](https://groceries.asda.com/product/910000325479?&cmpid=ppc-_-ghs-_--_-google-_--_-dskwid-s92700039041852916_dc&gclid=CjwKCAjw-OHkBRBkEiwAoOZqlzIKvWSU22vZgrZtEwv69-JGqj7X3BRDwhqHmGJX-ekHjmnEAI8K6BoCsh0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) which you just stir in to boiling water.
9. Add [medium egg noodles](https://groceries.asda.com/product/noodles/blue-dragon-medium-egg-noodles-nests/910000782454) to the stock and boiling water. Most egg noodles take around 4-7 minutes to boil and cook, so double check your timings.
10. If you have a meat thermometer, this is the best way to check your pork. As long as the meat is about 71 C / 160 F you should be good to go (the higher the temperature, the more well-done and tough the meat will feel. Aim for around 71 C / 160 F for a really tender cook).  
If you don't have a meat thermometer, you're going to have to judge it by eye. I'm no expert in this area, but Google can tell you how to tell when pork is cooked if you're not sure.
11. Once your pork is ready, slice it up and dump it in a bowl. Dump noodles on top and pour some of that stock water over the bowl. 
12. I top mine off with an egg poached in the microwave (I have a fancy kitchen gadget, but you can just it just as well in a mug or if you're a better chef than me you can do it on the hob with the pan).

  
The thing I love about this recipe is that you can switch out the meat for pretty much anything. Chicken, pork, beef, duck... The chicken stock goes quite nicely with all of these in my opinion. Meat and Noodles is my go-to comfort meal. If you have a steamer, this works especially well with steamed chicken thighs (steam for around 20 minutes depending on the thigh size).

You could always check out Struggle Meals by [Tastemade](https://www.youtube.com/user/tastemade/featured) on YouTube ( [Here's a link to the Season 1 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBbf4YbDefA&list=PLX98sAmndWt00CsyKGlZZ-eHmuV1ntWyy) ). All the menus are done on a budget, and he often does things like one tray meals or meals that you can make in bulk and freeze or store pre-mixed dry ingredients for later. Knowing that you've got a backlog of pre-prepped meals will help take the strain off you and your parents, and doing so on a budget might help if you ever have to do the grocery run or if finance/money worries are a part of your parents' depression.

I think it's awesome that you want to help your parents. You're so strong for taking this on to help them, and it's speaks volumes of your character that you've though to try and help them in this way. But don't lose sight of yourself - make sure to keep looking out for yourself, and make sure to reach out if you ever feel like you're struggling. Depression often creeps up on us when we least expect it, and it can be easy to focus so much on someone else that you forget to check in with yourself until it's too late.

4282,ejc6uu6,t3_b53fvi,"If your parents dont have any dietary restrictions, theres a few easy dishes you can make for them. When my dad got divorced from my mom when I was ~19, I went to his house to cook him some food, and it seemed to cheer him up a lot. Heres a few easy dishes you can make!

* **Get 1-2 pounds of chicken breasts, some pesto sauce (i prefer an organic jar, but you can also use the McCormick packets), cheese (I just get shredded mozzarella), and 1 or 2 small tomatoes. Put the chicken in a pan and cover them with the pesto sauce, put some slices of tomato on top, and lastly put the cheese on top of it. Bake it in the oven at 400^o F for ~40 minutes or until it looks ready. You can put some hot sauce on it too after you take it out of the oven for some spice if you're into that. If this isnt enough food then cut up the chicken and serve it over some pasta or a bed of white rice.**


* **Another easy dish I would make was just pesto pasta. Just get a jar of pesto sauce, a wedge of pecorino romano cheese, some cherry tomatoes, basil, lemon, and spinach if you like greens. Cook the noodles however you want, and once you finish straining them, put them in a pot, put the pesto in, and throw in the cherry tomatoes (i usually cut them in halves), squeeze half a lemon onto it, and throw in some cut up basil and spinach. Once you serve it, grate the cheese on top**


* **Tuna pasta salad is a good dish if you like tuna. Just get some noodles, 2 cans of tuna, relish, Italian salad dressing, and if you desire, mayo and onions. Cook the pasta however you want it, and after you strain it, put it in a pot, dump in the tuna (make sure you drain the water out of the tuna can first though), and put in as much relish and salad dressing as you want. Usually I do 3-4 tablespoons of relish and 1 or 2 tablespoons of the dressing, and just a pinch of salt, and pepper. I never use mayo or onions so put them in as desired. This can be served hot, or you can refrigerate it and serve it cold.**


* **Chicken quesadillas are surprisingly easy to make also. Get 1 or so pounds of chicken breasts (you can season them yourself, or get preseasoned ones at the store if you dont want it to be plain), some green onion, salsa, shredded taco cheese, diced tomatoes (or buy a tomato and dice it yourself), quesadillas, and some red/green peppers if you would like. Bake the chicken in the oven at 400^o F for ~40 minutes. Once they are done, take them out and cut, or shred them into small pieces. Once done, get a flat pan for the stove-top and put the heat on low or medium. Put butter on 1 side of each of the quesadillas, and get your ingredients ready beforehand. Place one of the quesadillas into the pan (butter side down), and then put your ingredients inside. Sprinkle the cheese all along the outer edge of the quesadilla as it is cooking, and then place the other quesadilla on top of everything, butter side up. Press it down with a spatula or something, and make sure that the cheese acts as glue to hold the edges together. Once the one side is looking browned and cooked, very carefully flip it over to cook the other side. I usually use a spatula in one hand, and a fork in the other to help control the flip. Once the other side looks good, take it out and cut it into fourths with a pizza cutter if you have one. Serve with a side of sour cream, and/or salsa for dipping them into (you can also put the salsa and sour cream inside once you initially cook it if you want)**


* **Steak isn't too bad to cook either. Go to a nice supermarket or if you have more money available, a nice butcher and get whatever cut you desire. I'd recommend starting with a small Ribeye if you have never cooked steak before, and grab some Thyme, and rosemary. Bring it home and set it on a plate, and let it sit for ~10-15 minutes to get to room temperature. Make sure you cover it with something when letting it sit like this. After you let it sit, season it with some salt and pepper on both sides, and get a pan ready on the stove with some butter, or olive oil in it. Make sure the heat is on medium-high or so. Once you see the butter melting, or the olive oil starting to bubble a little bit, it should be hot enough for the steak. Gently lay the steak down into the pan (make sure you lay it down away from you, in case anything splashes up), and cook each side to your desired temperature. I usually do ~5-6 minutes per side, or until it’s more firm since my dad liked his steaks cooked a little more well done. For rare, take the steak off the stove or turn the heat off at 130-135^o F, medium rare at 140^o F, medium at 155^o F, or well at 165^o F. Put the steak on a plate and let it rest for a couple of minutes, and serve it. If you want more food you can also cook rice, pasta, or some vegetables for a side.**


* **A simple grilled cheese is a good, easy thing to make too. Just get some tomatoes, butter, bread, and cheese. Butter one side of the bread and put the cheese, and a slice of tomato inside and place the other slice of butter on top. Make sure the buttered side is face up. Just lay it into a pan on medium or low heat and flip when nice and brown, and serve it cut in half. It’s a good fast meal. Each sandwich only takes a few minutes to finish.**

* **For breakfast you can make scrambled eggs, potatoes, toast, and bacon. Get any bacon and potatoes you want (I prefer Yukon gold), and some eggs. Crack 2 eggs into a bowl and whisk it with a fork. Pour the mixture into a pan that is already heated up, and every 1 or 2 minutes, pull the outside of the eggs inwards to the center with a spatula. Eventually they will come out scrambled after a few iterations of doing this. Just before you take them out of the pan sprinkle some salt and pepper on them. For the potatoes just dice them up as small as possible unless you want bigger pieces, and place them in a pan that is already hot with butter melted in it. Make sure the heat is on medium high for the potatoes and cover them. The steam will help to cook them faster and make them softer. Add pepper and salt as desired. For the bacon melt some butter in a pan on medium heat, and place the strips inside away from you like I mentioned with the steak. Let them cook until they look nice and crispy. Start the potatoes first, then the bacon, and lastly the eggs. The potatoes take the longest to cook, so by the time they finish, so should everything else**


* **Lastly, you could make them a calzone/Stromboli. I just get the Pillsbury pizza crust, some pizza sauce, shredded mozzarella cheese, and from here, you can grab whatever you want to put inside of it so its real easy to make to somebodys liking. For example, I would get a jar of banana peppers, a jar of green olives, spinach, tomatoes, pepperoni, and a jar of artichoke hearts. Once you have the ingredients you want, get a cookie sheet, and make sure you spray it with the nonstick stuff if the sheet isnt already nonstick. Roll the pizza crust onto it flat, and put down your sauce, all of your ingredients, and top it with cheese. Make sure you spread it out as much as possible. Once this is done, fold it shut in the middle, and pinch the entire thing shut with a fork on the edges. Make sure you poke a hole in the top of it after sealing shut! From here, you can put some more pizza sauce and cheese on top if you want more, or you can just leave it as is. Put it in the oven at the specified temperature on the packaging, and keep it in the oven for ~20-30 minutes. The edges will sometimes cook faster than the middle so the edges will be a little harder, than the middle. You can serve it whole, or cut it in half and serve it**

Eating food that contains tryptophanes (precursor of 5-HTP, which is the precursor of serotonin which is the 'happiness hormone') can help. Drinking St. John's Wort is also a natural way to help with depressions, but this can interfere with medication they take and they should not drink this (excessively) without a doctor's consultation.

Exercise may also help!

I'm sorry you have to go through this. Just know that it is not up to you to fix their depression. You're great because you're trying to help them, but it's you helping them. They have to take the lead themselves. Ask them to cook together! Exercise together. Have great conversations. And very important: don't forget to focus on your happiness. That'll help them too.

From a practical side, fish oil and omega 3s are really good for your brain and the inflammation issues that usually come along with depression, so fatty fish like salmon is great and easy. Mushrooms have lots of vitamin d which helps with seasonal depression, which compounds most people’s normal depression this time of year, and it boosts your immune system. Vitamin c is also an important mood booster, and I like to make thing like tropical fruit salad with pineapple, oranges, and mango mixed with garlic, a splash of coconut milk, Thai basil, and a squeeze of lime. Tropical fruit is in season and just the bright colors and flavors really brighten my mood, my mom just had surgery and I made it for her the other day. 

On a more emotional side, I tend to make the recipes I got from my husbands mom when he is really down, it reminds him of easier times and gives him comfort. Do you know their favorite foods? Even if you don’t know how to cook them I probably do and am very good at helping people learn to cook if you’re not already confident.

My father is very traditional and only eats Indian food, whereas my mother is more open but still prefers Indian food over anything else. We come from a low-income household in which both of my parents work two jobs to make ends meet. 

Everyday I prepare rice for them (my father has to have rice once a day) and reheat left over sides that were made by my mother when I'm at class (even when I tell her not to because her right arm gives her chronic pain everyday). Whenever we don't have many sides in the fridge, I usually make some type of hot stir-fry. When they come home, I always make Chai for them and give them a snack to eat with.  I occasionally make traditional Indian food but I'm not used to cooking it since it's kinda hard and uses ***a lot*** of ingredients. I stick with the simple stuff. Warm/hot foods are the best.

They tell me not to make food for them because I should be studying for exams (which I still do) but I know that they have it rough and sacrifice everything for their children. I can't ***not*** help them ya know. I'm trying to help them in any way I can. I got a job once but it interfered with my GAD and school so I had to quit. It's gonna suck since I'm moving out soon and they'll have to move into a one-bed apartment/condo. I won't be able to see them as often and I'm worried that something might happen to them.

* boiled eggs: start with at least six, keep them in the shell in the fridge.  These are good for a fast breakfast, slicing over a salad, or making into egg/tuna salad.  My husband likes to slice an egg and put it between bread with mayo.
* string cheese: when someone needs a little protein on the way out the door
* fresh fruit:  we portion these into 5.5 oz storage cups from walmart, but even just having some berries helps
* vanilla yogurt, granola, berries: make up some parfaits, they feel fance but are easy.  We do these in the same 5.5oz cups
* veggie tray: raw veggies aren't eaten much here unless they're in a tray served with ranch dip.  
* rotisserie chicken:  you can roast your own, but this is fast.  We shred ours right away and store it in the fridge to put into chili, enchiladas, top a salad, etc OR micro with bbq sauce and slap on a sandwich.

4316,ejcca50,t3_b53fvi,"All the top comments seem to be recommending anything that you can -- which is good advice -- but despite being late here's a super easy receipt that anyone should be able to do. It's also really quite healthy, which I hear is good for depression but I'm 100% not an expert.

Buy peppers (bell or the smaller bell peppers) - put a little olive oil & salt on them. Put them in a hot pan until the blacken then flip and blacken the other sides too. Should take about 5 mins total. Quick tip: less oil & more salt than you think.

Buy chicken thighs. Before you go to school throw them in a plastic bag with some sauce (your pick -- anything really works). When you get home get a pan hot (like 6-7 out of 10) then put them in the pan for 3-4 mins then flip to the other side for 3-3.5 mins.

They'll smoke some so turn a fan on.

Do the chicken first. Then do the peppers so you can let the chicken sit for the 4-5 mins the peppers take.

That's it. You're done. The whole thing takes 15 mins and all you need is peppers, chicken thighs, any sauce, salt, & oil. And if you're in a bind you can do without the oil. 

You can switch out the sauce and you've got a whole new meal :)",t3_b53fvi

4322,ejccoaq,t3_b53fvi,"Hey man. Let me echo so many other people and say that anything you cook showing that you care will be greatly appreciated by your parents. Second, I’ve found the saying that chicken noodle soup is good for the soul pretty darn accurate. So here goes-

Get a soup pot. You’re gonna want a pretty big one I’ve got 6 quart pretty wide base one that I love. 

You’ll need a big yellow onion, celery, a big carrot, 3 chicken thighs, a stick of butter, egg noodles, 32 oz chicken stock, 32 oz chicken bone broth, 32 oz chicken broth. Your choice on the low sodium. I typically get low sodium then salt to taste later. Black pepper, salt, celery seed, garlic powder, oregano. 

Cut up your aromatics (celery, onion, carrot). The smaller and more uniform the pieces the faster and more evenly they cook through. 
Toss the butter in and heat it up once it’s melted add the aromatics. These are gonna wanna cook for a while till they’re soft. You can salt them a bit and add some pepper and celery seed and garlic powder but don’t over do it. Once they’re soft put in your stock and broths and bring it to a simmer. 

While you’re waiting on your liquid to get up to temp get your thighs and remove the skin and excess fat. Leave the bone in because it helps them heat evenly and adds additional richness to your broth. Once you’ve got the liquid simmering add the trimmed thighs whole to the soup and cover and let that cook for 10 minutes or so. 

After they’ve cooked pull out the thighs and get two forks and pull the meat apart (think like pulled pork)  be careful not to burn yourself since they’re hot then toss the bones Add the chicken back in and add your noodles. This is another spot of personal preference but remember that the noodles will expand so be careful not to add too much. Stir this occasionally and continue to simmer until the noodles are soft. 

Once the noodles are soft you can finish adding your spices. Salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste, but make sure you’re adding a bit then stirring it in and tasting frequently to make sure you don’t over do it. Once you think you’ve got the salt/pepper right add the oregano but don’t over do it. 
Remember. If you got the regular sodium broths you may not need to add salt or add only a little. It’s all about taste here so make sure you’re testing it frequently. 

And there ya go. Some awesome made with love heart warming chicken noodle soup. 

I hope your parents start feeling better and I bet know their kid loves them so much will really help more so than the soup. ",t3_b53fvi

But comfort food is totally different depending on what someone likes, where they grew up, what they're used to eating, etc. Ask your parents what their parents made for them when they were sick as a child, and make that. If it were me doing this for my parents, I would make grilled cheese, macaroni, other pasta dishes, and soup because I know that's what my parents like. For myself, though, my comfort foods are things like sushi, dim sum, etc. because that's just what I love and what I always want when I'm craving something.

Also, you could try to incorporate foods that are known to fight depression and mental illness. A lot of comfort food, while it may be comforting, isn't super healthy, and lots of it (like the stuff I said I'd cook for my parents) is loaded with simple carbs that can make you more sleepy and lethargic. Some foods that are good for depression and brain health in general:

* Foods rich in vitamin D. Depending on where you live, vitamin D deficiency might be contributing to their depression, so a supplement might be good for them too. But some foods rich in vitamin D are: nuts, particularly tree nuts, milk, salmon, tuna, mackerel.
* In addition to vitamin D, try to use a variety of ingredients for a balanced, healthy diet. Try to include a rainbow of colors in your food, mostly by using lots of fruits and vegetables. If you can, buy fruits and vegetables that they can easily grab for a snack, like carrot sticks and hummus or dressing, sliced bell peppers, berries, bananas, etc.
* Some yummy and healthy but still ""comforting"" recipes to Google: chicken pot pie, lamb tikka masala, chop or chef salad, salmon and rice pilaf.

So taking a depressed person and doing something that would normally make them happy won't fix the situation.

Having said that, often depression can be made worse by the weight of responsibility.  Since one of the responsibilities of every adult is to feed themselves and their family, you can take that responsibility off their shoulders.  Lighten their day to day load and make it easier for them to get better on their own (or with the help of a therapist or medication or things like that).

To that end, the most important thing to make is to make something that lightens the responsibility from them.  So if they have a family to feed you should make something that the kids would want to eat but is also reasonably healthy.  If it's just for the sick person, again healthy is important it's just less restrictive on what kids like tooeat.

Hotdogs with a mix of mustard and mayo are always really good comfort food.

Quicky 'beef stroganoff""  is also good. Boil a pack of egg noodles (cheap) and then drain those and add them to a pot. In the pot, dump a can of condensed mushroom soup (add a LITTLE milk or water if a thinner consistency is 'sauce' is preferred) and then throw in some raw ground beef. Turn the stove on medium, mix up, and then stir until the beef is no longer pink. Taste it and add salt if needed.

You can also make breakfast stuff like bagels with cream cheese, eggs with bacon (use a pair of scissors to cut it into small bits and fry in the pan) and avocado slices. 

Sandwiches of all kinds work too. 

Healthy snacks are also good such as cherry tomatoes and baby carrots. Give them lots of water. 

If your parents struggle just to go to the grocery store, inform them that Walmart Grocery ([grocery.walmart.com](https://grocery.walmart.com)) does FREE online ordering and grocery pickup.

That's fine, I get it - I more than get it, but this is a constant issue; and I'm always the one ""paying"" for their lack of care. They do not care if the trash doesn't get taken out, or the meat doesn't get defrosted - it's me that suffers for their lack of care. It's now me, that after coming home has to stand over a stove for another 30 minutes because they couldn't take 30 minutes out of their day (as a stay at home 'person') to help me.

Then take about 4 eggs per person and crack them into a bowl. If the shell breaks into the bowl use the biggest shell piece to pick out the little bits because they stick to eachother.

Depression is a bitch, a burden, and it fucks up many lives, not only the patients. Its prevalence its really high and sadly we tend to normalize it.

If you can't convince them to take therapy do it yourself and have the therapist advise you on how to proceed. I really congratulate you on your efforts and wish you the best because that is all that I can do.

I don't know about the US (or if you are in the US) but there should exist some sort of institution that offers free therapy. 

And most important, take care of your own mental and physical health. It may and will feel selfish sometimes BUT if you are incapacitated you won't be able to help anyone.

4495,ejbmc55,t1_ejb9b6f,"I'm sure I don't really need to tell you this but you may be surprised at what a 13 year old can do if they set their mind to it. I started cooking small things in elementary school. Mostly baked goods and ice cream. By the time I was 13 i was cooking full family meals (6 to 12 people) without any assistance. Partly out of necessity and partly because I enjoy cooking. I would just get home from school. Check to see what my mom took out for dinner and start cooking. I would usually be done about the time my parents got home from work and my brothers were about to leave for football practice. 

Also this taught me the importance of cleaning and how to properly clean.

If your child doesn't know much about cooking I recommend starting with baked goods. It teaches you how things work together as well as precise measurements. Also a lot of kids struggle with fractions and it's a good hands on way to learn. Then get into real dishes. Maybe start with things that can be baked since they will be familiar with the over and slowly introduce stove top cooking. Maybe start with sauteed things like onions and peppers to use as toppers. This will teach how to use seasonings as well. Then once they have a handle on all of that plus the cooking lingo just start giving them recipes and see how it goes. ",t3_b53fvi

If I'm feeling down and out, I want some damn real buffalo style vinegary chicken wings, but this is something a teenager should be able to cook.

This turned me on to carbonara recipes, which turned me on to actual carbonara recipes, which really opened me up.  I have a poor sense of smell, so I gotta really taste it, so I generally lean to spicy food, but there's so much taste that can just come from the cooking method, or the cut, that you can really change a plate with simply methods: think eating three hard boiled eggs vs a three egg omlette, completely different.  Thick quartered mushrooms are way more earthy than sliced.  A grilled top round is a thousand times different than the same cut cubed with five hours in the slow cooker.

Final note, if OP wants a nice easy balsamic chicken slow cooker recipe, here it is: http://paleorunningmom.blogspot.com/2013/08/crockpot-balsamic-chicken.html

Side note: slow cooker instructions all suck.  You gotta get used to your cooker, and the timing can be all off. If I have raw chicken, I'm marinating it the day before in the mix (minus the olive oil, that really just coats the cooker).  If I'm cooking it on a work day, I'm going 4 hours on low, with the keep warm setting on and it's still dry. But if it's a Sunday and I'm home, I'm going 4-5 hours on low and testing the temperature. Everyone recommends 6-8 but that's probably too much and will dry out the chicken. Chicken isn't hard to cook, it's amazingly versatile, but you can destroy it by drying it out.",t3_b53fvi

[Magnesium shares some interesting parallels to ketamine.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201410/magnesium-and-the-ketamine-connection).

[It's deficiency is associated with sleeplessness, depression, anxiety, etc](https://www.drperlmutter.com/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms-causes-treatments/).  

[It's supplementation, along with Zinc (possibly, also, B2 which are the three ingredients that make up ZMA) is believed to relieve cravings for nicotine & both Zinc and Magnesium test low in the serum levels of those prone to nicotine use.  Apparently, this white paper concluded that nicotine demonstrates an interesting physiologically-psychological type of addiction wherein smoking somehow induces higher zinc/magnesium serum levels which you subconsciously are rewarded for simply by feeling a little less shit](https://www.omicsonline.org/magnesium-and-zinc-involvement-in-tobacco-addiction-2155-6105.S2-005.php?aid=6610).

They’re proud of you and their mental health is not negatively influenced by you in any way. It’s a series of events that lead to depression and know that you’re the light of their lives. You can express your worry and fears to them, tell them how you’re afraid to lose them and that you wish them to be happy and healthy. This way you allow yourself to be vulnerable while making it clear you’re there for them and that you want them to become happy again.

Fixing depression isn’t anyone’s task, including a psychologist or psychiatrist, but the depressed person themselves. All a psychologist does is guide you in the process of getting better, all anti-depressants do is make your head clearer so you can prioritize your mental health so you, yourself, can work on becoming better.

There is no magical solution or happy pill to get rid of mental health issues, it’s a lengthy process of making decisions in your mental health’s benefit. It includes making mistakes and sometimes having to do a step backwards. They need guidance to better themselves but that will never be your job.

Mental illness is often an imbalance of chemicals in the brain that need to be treated with medication. The meds can make you feel so much better (sometimes you have to try a few different meds to find the one that works for you. There is a DNA test that shows what meds are more likely to work with the fewest side effects. 

Online classes are awesome. I’d do as many of those as I could because I can study better by myself. Hang in there!

I also have a delicious and easy pot roast recipe. 

Get a 3-4lb chuck roast. Salt and pepper it all over. If you want, you can cut the roast into a few smaller pieces and salt and pepper all over.

Brown in a large deep pot with a little olive oil. Set the meat aside

Dice up a few onions and sauté in a little olive oil until carmelized all over. 15-20 minutes 

Add the browned meat. 

Peel and chop up some carrots. I love carrots and add several in large pieces. 

Add some large pieces of celery—a roast is the perfect recipe to use the inside leafy parts because it flavors the liquid. Fresh parsley, thyme, and a little rosemary is also delicious.

Dump in a bottle of cheap red wine. Boil until the wine mixture has been reduced by half. Turn heat down, put the lid on the pot, and let simmer for a couple of hours. You can also simmer the pot by putting in a 350F oven. 

You can also some beef bouillon powder —1-2 cubes or beef better than bouillon paste,  2 tsp. Mix up and taste. You can add more if you want. The better than bouillon won a taste comparison by American Test Kitchen, and it’s super delicious. Although it is more expensive. You don’t need a lot though. 

You can also add some sliced potatoes when you put the pot on simmer. Or make mashed potatoes to serve with the roast. The meat is done when it falls apart when you pull it apart with two forks. If it’s not super tender, put it back on the heat for another 30 minutes to an hour. Take the meat and carrots/potatoes out. 

You can thicken the liquid into gravy by mixing 2 T of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of cold water. Mix with a fork until the lumps dissolve. Pour the slurry into the liquid and heat until boiling. The liquid will thicken in a few minutes. If you want it thicker, add a little more slurry.",t3_b53fvi

I would really love having a large freezer so I can freeze big containers of chopped vegetables, homemade stocks, herbs in olive oil or butter, fruits like strawberries and peaches when they’re in season, leftovers of soups, meats, rice, etc. so I can heat up a homemade meal on a bad day. I have a vacuum sealer which really comes in handy. 

You can get an upright freezer that would be easier for your dad to get stuff out of. I have had a small chest freezer before my back got so bad. I used milk crates and plastic bins to organize everything.

I have issues sleeping at night but when I took melatonin it interfered with the synthroid. My doctor wouldn't give me clonazepam so the odd time I have a drink to help me sleep on the weekend.

If you wanna go fancy, my go to recipe for something like this is chicken picatta. It's chicken with capers, and my family always adds gnocchi. Get some premade gnocchi at the store. Boil it per the package and then pan fry it until it gets a little brown and crunchy.

Get some chicken breasts and make sure they are thin. You can cut them or pound them. Here's a good recipe to use: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/chicken-piccata-recipe2-1913809

Afterwards I like to throw in the gnocchi and fry it a little more alongside the chicken to flavor it up. Then serve. Cooking chicken imo is a bit daunting. Make sure the pan is not too hot at first as it will only cook the outside. Take your time cooking it. I recommend having a cook thermometer to check the internal temp to make sure it is cooked. Don't go too long, check regularly as to not dry it out. If you cook the outside too long and it is browning but the inside is uncooked/raw, throw it in a pan in the oven in some liquid (I usually use olive oil), cover with aluminum foil, bake for ~15 min at 425. This will cook the insides without drying it out.

The dish is on the more briney side so if that is not a preference, just season some chicken breasts to go alongside a homemade alfredo sauce. And seriously gnocchi is the bomb. It is a much fancier looking pasta and IMO the texture is delightful :)",t3_b53fvi

Even if we're talking bad-bad, the important part is that you've learned and grown, meaning, even if you were indeed in any shape or form a ""bad"" person and did worse than just normal human mistakes, you've outgrown that person and are not that anymore.

It's also important for your own mental health to be kind to yourself. Literally nobody is perfect, and the whole point of growth is that you're not that person anymore and wouldn't make the same mistakes again. You'll make new ones, but that's just life, you'll continue to grow and learn and do better, and being able to do that instead of sticking fingers in your ears and doubling down in order to avoid admitting to mistakes, that's a really really good thing. That's what defines you, and you should be really proud of that.

Try to actively say that to yourself whenever you have a bad thought about your past choices to balance out the negativity, because for one, it's not actually fair to you, and it also has a huge impact on your mental health. If you tell yourself you're a bad person often enough, you'll eventually believe it, and that's obviously deeply destructive to your feeling of self-worth and can lead to depression or at worst to self-destructing even more.

Figuring out how to make them feel loved or let them know that they aren't alone or take some of the burden off of them can be a huge challenge.

OP, the fact that you want to learn to care for your parents in ways they will be able to feel and internalize is wonderful. It's a good instinct, and you should cultivate it.

But as you do, set your expectations low.

Depression isn't logical or mathematical. It's not a matter of adding something to the ""circumstance"" side of the equation so that the ""emotion"" side of the equation rises from negative to positive. If that was how it worked, they probably wouldn't be depressed: I'm sure there are a lot of hard things in their lives, but it also sounds like they've been raising a capable, entrepreneurial and creative teenager who cares about them a lot, and that's usually something parents take a lot of joy in.

Depression is a multifaceted, psychological/neurological/psychiatric thing, a combination of chemical imbalances and ingrained habits of thought and a bunch of other complicated things. Doing something to make them happy is not the same thing as helping their depression. You can make them happy and they can be depressed and both of those things can be true and happening at the same time.

It's also important to remember that, even if you make them happy with something you do, people who are dealing with depression often don't feel things as strongly as they usually do. If they don't seem very enthusiastic about your gestures or visibly grateful for/touched by your persistent care for them, **that's not your fault, and it's not a sign that they don't care about you**. It's a symptom of their depression.

The best way to help is to figure out how to connect them to a trained, licensed mental health professional, but they have to be willing to work with them or it's not going to go anywhere.

Now that all of that is out of the way, **an answer to your actual question about learning to cook food that might help them feel good**: Search YouTube for ""Basics With Babish."" It's a YouTube show about learning to cook and learning your way around a kitchen. There are some episodes on basic kitchen skills, and some on kitchen equipment, and then episodes on things like how to cook comfort foods or easier ways to make dishes that seem more complicated.

The key to making sure that you don't upset your stomach with magnesium is to make sure you buy a formula that has high bioavailability. Some absorb as badly as 6%

Products like magnesium amino acid chelate (particularly glycinate), magnesium orotate, aspartate and citrate. Also if labelled organic is good (think organic chemistry, not pesticide free). About 300mg is good for a solid single dose, around 600/day maximum needed without professional advice (no matter how stressed you are or how shit your sleep is).

Powdered formulas tend to be good as they often contain mallic acid, which helps a lot. A good magnesium powder is a handy way to unwind. Tablet/capsule formulas which have very high amounts or boast ""one a day"" tend to be the ones with the worst absorption. ",t3_b53fvi

Fish don't help because they can't really communicate with you, but rats are REALLY smart and like to do puzzle games and activities with you. I'm not a big fan of them but I've heard people rave about them. Mice are assholes. Hamsters can also be interesting and fun to watch or play with. Ferrets, while smelly and need a lot of cleaning are definitely the kind of animal that will form a caring bond. Guinea pigs are so boring, rabbits usually are too and can get pretty gross quickly. Chinchillas are cute, but deceptive- they are psychopaths, they will try to EAT EVERYTHING (their cage, wires, the wall, carpet, clothes...) and they practically fly, I don't want to talk about it. 

Snakes and small lizards won't really give you that deep connection feeling, but the larger lizards can have a bit of personality to them and show that they like certain things and being handled pretty often. I strongly suggest AGAINST getting a large bird unless you have at least 4 hours a day to interact with them out of cage, enough resources to research and train them, and decades of your life to devote once they've bonded to you, but they are extremely intelligent and can verbally and emotionally communicate with you, although they can be stubborn, difficult and mistrustful if not trained exactly right. 

My top suggestion though would of course be a dog or cat. I used to not be a fan of cats, but I learned if you get them young and condition them right, they can be wonderfully affectionate. A puppy is a huge commitment and takes a lot of work if you want them to learn certain things, but there's nothing more rewarding than earning the trust and friendship of an older adopted dog with intelligence- usually something mixed with any type of the hounds, collies, cattle dogs, poodles, or shepherd family. Terrier mixes are smart too, but those breeds tend to develop some horrible behavioral habits when left unchecked. 

I like suggesting the older dogs (between 5 and 8) because usually they are a bit more calm by that age and don't need as much energy from you, plus depending on how long they were in the shelter most of them are just happy to have run of the home and a couple toys or bones to chew on whenever you're away. 

Just the act of taking care of a pet and seeing them get excited to go for a walk or spend time with you whenever you come home or get them out of the cage is deeply rewarding and fulfilling. If you were speaking of ""people loneliness"" instead of general loneliness then listen to the other comments about regular visits to popular parks and the group activity meetups that can be found on forums or places like facebook. I just love animals so much that I can't help but think of all the hiking, snuggling, and puzzle solving pet buddies out there that are more than happy to love us with everything they have anytime I think about someone feeling lonely.

P.S. I'm sorry you feel ugly, I too am what I would consider unattractive, but it's important to know that people can see attractiveness in different ways. If it wasn't for that I wouldn't have found someone I wanted to share my life with because I am picky and not very attractive. Most of the world is shallow and the people who make decisions based on their brain and heart are not usually the social butterflies- they're mostly introverts or shy like you and I which is why they're never easy to find. The only way to find them is to keep going to new places and put yourself out there. If you are a guy it's best to do so looking to be friends at first, as almost all women can be very guarded until they get to know someone. Plus, the type of people i'm talking about, the ones you can really count on in the long run, won't even know if they are attracted to you until you get to know each other anyway.

People go to social gatherings to connect, and you can connect better with people if you're fully focused on the conversation you're having instead of your internal monologue. People will be drawn to you if you make them feel heard, and the ones worth being friends with will want you to feel noticed and connected as well. Practice makes perfect, but if you don't know where to start, try attending a beginners class for something hands on or a board game night and just focus on being present in the moment and conversation.",t3_b53fvi

Short term, when suicidal people (actively or not) have an outside force intervene on their life,  *especially* when that outside force is intervening at the behest of a loved one, they see it as the worst betrayal. ""How could you have me involuntarily committed?"", ""The police handcuffed me, put me in a car and brought me to an institution and you caused it"" etc etc.

Some come to terms/get over/forgive/are greatly thankful. Some, even with having gotten better, that betrayal sticks and things are never the same.

4848,ejbdyqb,t1_ejb903x,"If your chicken breasts are thin you shouldn't have to throw them in the oven ever.

I usually get my best results by doing the following:

1. Let the chicken sit out for a little bit before cooking (at least 15 minutes)
2. Get the pan nice and hot, then add butter; if it's not sizzling it's too cold.
3. Salt and pepper on the chicken and into the pan
4. Let it cook.  You do need to keep an eye on your pan temps a bit here, but as long as your butter isn't burning, your chicken isn't burning.  If it starts to look like your butter is getting a bit smoky, lower your temps as that's your warning about burning your butter.
5. Flip the chicken well past the point it looks like the cooked part has creeped halfway up the side.  The outside always cooks faster, and your goal is to flip it when it's cooked about 50% through in the middle.  This really is something that you learn by feel, and imo if you aren't sure it's far better to err on the side of waiting too long.
6. Leave the chicken be until it is fully cooked.  Now a meat thermometer is fine and dandy, but unless your breast is thick don't bother.  There's two ways of determining doneness that I use - looking for juices and the poke test.  Looking for juices is pretty simple - it's done when juices start coming out of the top.  The poke test requires poking a number of breasts at various degrees of doneness, but a fully cooked breast will respond differently than one that is still raw.",t3_b53fvi
